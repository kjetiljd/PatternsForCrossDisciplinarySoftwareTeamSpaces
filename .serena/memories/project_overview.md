# Project Overview: PatternsForCrossDisciplinarySoftwareTeamSpaces

## Purpose
This project is a comprehensive pattern language repository that documents 50+ patterns for designing physical and organizational environments for cross-disciplinary software product teams in the hybrid work era. It bridges multiple disciplines including architecture, organizational psychology, software engineering, interior design, product management, and epistemology.

## Key Goals
- Provide evidence-based guidance for creating high-performance, human-centric software team spaces
- Support hybrid-first work approaches (distributed teams with occasional co-location)
- Document patterns that promote aligned autonomy - teams operate independently while maintaining organizational alignment
- Ensure compliance with Norwegian building codes for accessibility, daylight access, and indoor climate

## Pattern Categories
1. **Architectural/Spatial Patterns** (10 patterns) - Physical space design from building layout to furniture
2. **Organizational Patterns** (25 patterns) - Team structures, processes, and collaboration practices
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Patterns** (11 patterns) - Lessons from research labs, maker spaces, architectural studios
4. **Temporal Patterns** (9 patterns) - Rhythms, rituals, and time-based practices
5. **Meta-Patterns** (6 patterns) - Overarching themes and principles

## Content Type
- Primarily documentation in Markdown format
- Academic/research-oriented content with practical implementation guides
- Each pattern includes context, problem statement, solution, forces, and related patterns
- Total of 105 Markdown files in the repository

## Target Audience
- Software teams and organizations optimizing work environments
- Architects and space designers working with tech companies
- Product coaches and organizational consultants
- Researchers studying space, team dynamics, and software development
