# Rhythms of Collaboration and Focus

## Summary
Alternate between convergent team time and divergent individual work to optimize both collaboration and deep work.

## Context
Software teams need both collaborative time for alignment and coordination, and individual focus time for complex problem-solving.

## Problem
Without intentional rhythms, teams can get stuck in either constant collaboration or isolated individual work, missing the benefits of both.

## Solution
Create intentional rhythms that alternate between convergent collaborative activities and divergent individual focus work.

## Forces
- Collaboration vs. individual focus
- Convergent vs. divergent thinking
- Scheduled rhythms vs. organic flow
- Team coordination vs. personal productivity
