# Productive Traces Preservation

**Summary**: Distinguish between beneficial signs of use and actual problems, preserving evidence of successful adaptations while addressing genuine issues.

## Context

Facilities management often treats all deviations from original design as problems to be corrected. This can eliminate valuable evidence of how teams have successfully adapted their environment to work better.

## Problem

Over-zealous cleaning and "restoration" to original state can erase the accumulated wisdom of team adaptations. When maintenance removes all traces of use, teams lose social signals about what modifications are acceptable and beneficial.

## Solution

**Develop nuanced maintenance practices** that preserve beneficial traces while addressing genuine problems. Train facilities teams to recognize the difference between productive adaptations and actual issues requiring correction.

**Preserve beneficial traces:**
- Wear patterns that indicate efficient movement routes
- Team modifications that improve functionality
- Visible organization systems developed by teams
- Evidence of space evolution and learning

**Address genuine problems:**
- Safety hazards and code violations
- Damage that impairs function
- Hygiene issues that affect health
- Deterioration that will worsen if ignored

**Create documentation systems:**
- Before/after photos of beneficial adaptations
- Stories about why modifications were made
- Guidelines for what constitutes "good" versus "bad" traces
- Team input on which changes to preserve

## Forces

- **Learning amplification**: Beneficial traces teach other teams about possible improvements
- **Cultural signaling**: What gets preserved communicates organizational values
- **Efficiency evolution**: Spaces improve through accumulated small adaptations
- **Safety requirements**: Some modifications may create genuine hazards
- **Aesthetic balance**: Finding harmony between functionality and appearance

## Examples

**Toyota Production System**: Preserves worker improvements to workstations while maintaining safety and quality standards.

**Research laboratories**: Distinguish between productive modifications that improve research capability and changes that create safety risks.

**University libraries**: Preserve student-created study configurations that improve space utilization while maintaining accessibility and safety.

**Software development spaces**: Keep team-created information radiators and workflow adaptations while addressing ergonomic or electrical safety issues.
