# Fractal Autonomy, Layered Alignment

## Summary
Create self-managing units at every scale with thin coordination layers that maintain alignment without constraining autonomy.

## Context
Organizations need to balance autonomy at multiple scales while maintaining coherence and alignment toward shared goals.

## Problem
Traditional hierarchies can stifle autonomy, while complete autonomy can lead to fragmentation and misalignment.

## Solution
Create fractal patterns of autonomy where self-managing units exist at every scale, connected by thin layers of coordination that maintain alignment.

## Forces
- Autonomy vs. alignment
- Local optimization vs. global coherence
- Coordination overhead vs. self-management benefits
- Scalability vs. personal relationships
