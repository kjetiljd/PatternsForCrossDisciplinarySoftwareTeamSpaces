# Spaces that Empower and Invite

## Summary
Design environments that give people control and encourage contribution, creating spaces that feel welcoming and empowering rather than constraining.

## Context
Work environments can either empower people to do their best work or create barriers that limit effectiveness and engagement.

## Problem
Spaces that feel controlling or unwelcoming can reduce motivation, creativity, and collaboration, while empowering spaces can enhance all of these.

## Solution
Design spaces that give people control over their environment and clearly invite participation and contribution through thoughtful design choices.

## Forces
- Empowerment vs. consistency
- Individual control vs. shared spaces
- Invitation vs. intrusion
- Flexibility vs. structure
