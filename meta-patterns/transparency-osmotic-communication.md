# Transparency and Osmotic Communication

## Summary
Enable information flow through physical and cultural transparency that allows knowledge to spread naturally through the organization.

## Context
Effective organizations need information to flow freely to enable good decision-making and knowledge sharing across teams.

## Problem
Information silos and barriers to communication can prevent organizations from learning and adapting effectively.

## Solution
Create both physical and cultural transparency that enables osmotic communication, where information flows naturally through the organization.

## Forces
- Transparency vs. privacy
- Information flow vs. information overload
