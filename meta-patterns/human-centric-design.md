# Human-Centric Design

## Summary
Design work environments around human needs, behaviors, and well-being rather than forcing people to conform to rigid organizational or spatial systems.

## Context
Any work environment design decision, from physical space layout to organizational structure to technology choices.

## Problem
Traditional workplace design often prioritizes efficiency, cost, or control over human needs, leading to stress, reduced creativity, and poor outcomes.

## Solution
Start every design decision with human needs:
- **Psychological safety**: Create environments where people feel safe to take risks and speak up
- **Neurodiversity accommodation**: Design for different cognitive processing styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), attention patterns (sustained vs. burst focus), and sensory sensitivities (light, sound, texture, movement)
- **Diverse needs**: Accommodate different personality types, work styles, and accessibility requirements
- **Biophilic elements**: Include natural light, plants, and outdoor access
- **Choice and control**: Give people options in how they work and where they work
- **Cognitive flexibility**: Support different thinking styles through varied spatial configurations and interaction modes
- **Whole person**: Consider that people bring their full selves to work
- **Well-being first**: Prioritize health and happiness as foundations for productivity

## Forces
- Humans have evolved needs that don't match industrial workplace design
- Neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.) process information differently and have distinct environmental needs
- Sensory processing differences affect concentration, stress levels, and performance
- One-size-fits-all environments exclude significant portions of the population
- Diversity of individuals requires flexibility in solutions
- Stress and discomfort reduce cognitive performance
- Trust and safety are prerequisites for innovation
- People resist environments that feel dehumanizing
- Cognitive diversity strengthens team problem-solving when properly supported

## Examples

### Research-Backed Implementations
- **University of Melbourne Study**: Introducing plants into previously barren office spaces increased productivity by 15% (2024)
- **University of Exeter Research**: Employees working in environments with plants performed better on memory and attention tests compared to those in plant-free environments (2024)
- **Google's Project Aristotle**: Identified psychological safety as the #1 predictor of team effectiveness across 180 teams (2015)
- **Weber et al. Systematic Review**: Over 50% of studies showed environmental control (lighting, sound, temperature) significantly improved neurodivergent worker performance (2024)

### Organizational Implementations
- **Microsoft**: Inclusive design practices for neurodivergent employees with measurable performance improvements
- **Auticon**: Autism-friendly workplace adaptations (noise-canceling headphones, dimmable LED lighting with blue light filters, clear visual communication protocols, fidget tools, and quiet retreat spaces)
- **SAP**: Neurodiversity programs providing sensory-friendly workspaces with 90% employee retention rates
- **Norwegian Workplace Standards**: Mandated daylight access and indoor climate regulations showing 23% reduction in sick leave
- **Basecamp**: "Grown-ups treating each other like grown-ups" approach correlating with 40% lower turnover rates

### Biophilic Design Evidence
- **Natural Light Research**: Participants exposed to natural light had lower cortisol levels and reported feeling more relaxed than those under artificial light (2024)
- **Biophilic Restoration Pods**: Employees taking breaks in biophilic environments showed lower anxiety scores and higher cognitive performance (2024)
- **Building Standards Integration**: WELL Building Standard v2, Living Building Challenge 4.1, and LEED v5 now explicitly require biophilic design elements
