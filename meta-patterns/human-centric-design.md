# Human-Centric Design

## Summary
Design work environments around human needs, behaviors, and well-being rather than forcing people to conform to rigid organizational or spatial systems.

## Context
Any work environment design decision, from physical space layout to organizational structure to technology choices.

## Problem
Traditional workplace design often prioritizes efficiency, cost, or control over human needs, leading to stress, reduced creativity, and poor outcomes.

## Solution
Start every design decision with human needs:
- **Psychological safety**: Create environments where people feel safe to take risks and speak up
- **Diverse needs**: Accommodate different personality types, work styles, and accessibility requirements
- **Biophilic elements**: Include natural light, plants, and outdoor access
- **Choice and control**: Give people options in how they work and where they work
- **Whole person**: Consider that people bring their full selves to work
- **Well-being first**: Prioritize health and happiness as foundations for productivity

## Forces
- Humans have evolved needs that don't match industrial workplace design
- Diversity of individuals requires flexibility in solutions
- Stress and discomfort reduce cognitive performance
- Trust and safety are prerequisites for innovation
- People resist environments that feel dehumanizing

## Examples
- Alexander's "organic" approach to architecture
- Basecamp's "grown-ups treating each other like grown-ups"
- Norwegian workplace regulations prioritizing daylight and well-being
- Psychological safety research informing team practices
