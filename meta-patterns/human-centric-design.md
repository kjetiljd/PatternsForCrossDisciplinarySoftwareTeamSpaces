# Human-Centric Design

## Summary
Design work environments around human needs, behaviors, and well-being rather than forcing people to conform to rigid organizational or spatial systems.

## Context
Any work environment design decision, from physical space layout to organizational structure to technology choices.

## Problem
Traditional workplace design often prioritizes efficiency, cost, or control over human needs, leading to stress, reduced creativity, and poor outcomes.

## Solution
Start every design decision with human needs:
- **Psychological safety**: Create environments where people feel safe to take risks and speak up
- **Neurodiversity accommodation**: Design for different cognitive processing styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), attention patterns (sustained vs. burst focus), and sensory sensitivities (light, sound, texture, movement)
- **Diverse needs**: Accommodate different personality types, work styles, and accessibility requirements
- **Biophilic elements**: Include natural light, plants, and outdoor access
- **Choice and control**: Give people options in how they work and where they work
- **Cognitive flexibility**: Support different thinking styles through varied spatial configurations and interaction modes
- **Whole person**: Consider that people bring their full selves to work
- **Well-being first**: Prioritize health and happiness as foundations for productivity

## Forces
- Humans have evolved needs that don't match industrial workplace design
- Neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.) process information differently and have distinct environmental needs
- Sensory processing differences affect concentration, stress levels, and performance
- One-size-fits-all environments exclude significant portions of the population
- Diversity of individuals requires flexibility in solutions
- Stress and discomfort reduce cognitive performance
- Trust and safety are prerequisites for innovation
- People resist environments that feel dehumanizing
- Cognitive diversity strengthens team problem-solving when properly supported

## Examples
- Alexander's "organic" approach to architecture
- Basecamp's "grown-ups treating each other like grown-ups"
- Norwegian workplace regulations prioritizing daylight and well-being
- Microsoft's inclusive design practices for neurodivergent employees
- Auticon's autism-friendly workplace adaptations (noise-canceling headphones, dimmable LED lighting with blue light filters, clear visual communication protocols, fidget tools, and quiet retreat spaces)
- SAP's neurodiversity programs providing sensory-friendly workspaces
- Psychological safety research informing team practices
