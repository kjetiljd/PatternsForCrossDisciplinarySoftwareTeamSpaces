# Display of Work

## Summary
Leave prototypes and work-in-progress visible to invite curiosity and cross-pollination of ideas across teams.

## Context
Teams create valuable artifacts, prototypes, and work-in-progress that could inspire and inform other teams if made visible.

## Problem
When work is hidden away, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other's approaches and discover unexpected connections between projects.

## Solution
Create dedicated spaces for displaying current work, prototypes, and visual artifacts where team members can see and be inspired by each other's progress.

## Forces
- Work visibility vs. intellectual property concerns
- Polished display vs. authentic work-in-progress
- Dedicated display space vs. workspace efficiency
- Physical vs. digital display formats
