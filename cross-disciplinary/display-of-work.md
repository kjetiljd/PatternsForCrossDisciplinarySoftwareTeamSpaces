# Display of Work

## Summary
Leave prototypes and work-in-progress visible. This invites curiosity and helps ideas spread across teams.

## Context
Teams create valuable artifacts, prototypes, and work-in-progress. These could inspire and inform other teams if made visible. Success requires a culture that values transparency and psychological safety around sharing imperfect work. Teams also need commitment to ongoing curation and maintenance.

## Problem
When teams hide their work, they miss opportunities to learn from each other's approaches. They also miss unexpected connections between projects. Empty display spaces send a signal that sharing work is not expected or valued.

## Solution
Create dedicated spaces for displaying current work, prototypes, and visual artifacts. Team members can see and be inspired by each other's progress. Use systematic display design, rotation protocols, and engagement techniques.

**Display Design Guidelines:**

*Physical Display Infrastructure:*
- **Magnetic walls**: 4'x8' steel-backed surfaces with magnetic strips for easy repositioning
- **Pin-up boards**: High-quality cork or fabric surfaces that don't damage when pinned
- **Rotating display stands**: Mobile units that can be repositioned based on foot traffic patterns
- **Integrated lighting**: 3000K LED strips or track lighting to eliminate shadows and glare
- **Accessibility compliance**: All displays positioned between 15" and 48" from floor level

*Digital Display Integration:*
- **Interactive touchscreens**: 55" 4K displays for digital artifacts and collaborative annotation
- **QR code linking**: Physical displays include QR codes linking to digital documentation
- **Live project feeds**: Real-time updates from development tools and progress tracking
- **Multi-format support**: Displays accommodate both physical prototypes and digital outputs
- **Remote viewing capability**: Camera integration for distributed team access

*Display Layout Principles:*
- **Proximity grouping**: Related work items displayed within 6-foot visual clusters
- **Sight line optimization**: Displays positioned along natural walking paths and gathering areas
- **Hierarchical organization**: Current work at eye level, historical context above, detail views below
- **Interaction zones**: 3-foot minimum clearance around displays for comfortable viewing and discussion
- **Visual breathing space**: 20% of display area kept clear to avoid cognitive overload

**Rotation Protocols:**

*Content Lifecycle Management:*

1. **Active Display Phase (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Current work-in-progress prominently featured
   - Daily updates encouraged for rapidly evolving projects
   - Team members add sticky note comments and questions
   - Progress photos and iteration documents accumulated

2. **Mature Display Phase (2-3 weeks)**:
   - Completed work with lessons learned documents
   - Success metrics and outcomes clearly visible
   - Connection points to other projects highlighted
   - Invitation for others to build upon or adapt approaches

3. **Archive Transition Phase (1 week)**:
   - Digital documentation created before physical removal
   - Key artifacts moved to permanent collection or storage
   - Impact stories and collaboration outcomes documented
   - Space prepared for incoming work displays

*Rotation Schedule Framework:*
- **Monday Morning Review**: Teams assess current displays and plan updates
- **Mid-Week Fresh Content**: New work items added, outdated content flagged
- **Friday Afternoon Harvest**: Weekly reflection on what displays generated most engagement
- **Monthly Deep Refresh**: Major reorganization based on foot traffic and interaction patterns

*Curator Role Implementation:*
- **Display Stewards**: Rotating 2-week assignments for maintaining specific display areas
- **Content Shepherds**: Team members responsible for documenting and transitioning their work
- **Community Curators**: Cross-team volunteers who facilitate connections between displayed work
- **Archive Maintainers**: Long-term keepers of institutional memory and searchable collections

**Engagement Techniques:**

*Interactive Elements:*

1. **Annotation Opportunities**:
   - Sticky note parking lots for questions and observations
   - Shared whiteboard space next to displays for collaborative sketching
   - Comment QR codes linking to digital discussion threads
   - "Build on this" invitation cards for extending displayed work

2. **Guided Discovery Activities**:
   - **Weekly "Gallery Walks"**: 30-minute structured tours with work creators as guides
   - **Monthly "Cross-Pollination Sessions"**: Facilitated discussions connecting work across teams
   - **Quarterly "Innovation Archaeology"**: Deep dives into how displayed work evolved over time
   - **"Maker Rounds"**: Peer review of work-in-progress (like medical rounds)

*Social Proof Mechanisms:*

1. **Visibility Metrics**:
   - **Engagement tracking**: Simple dot voting for "this inspired me" or "I learned from this"
   - **Collaboration stories**: Documented cases where displayed work led to team cooperation
   - **Iteration evidence**: Before/after photos showing how feedback influenced development
   - **Connection mapping**: Visual network of how displayed work influenced other projects

2. **Recognition Systems**:
   - **"Display of the Month"**: Community voting for most engaging or educational display
   - **"Cross-Pollination Awards"**: Recognition for work that inspired collaboration across teams
   - **"Process Transparency Champions"**: Celebrating teams that share authentic work-in-progress
   - **"Evolution Stories"**: Show how displayed work changed based on community feedback

*Structured Engagement Events:*

1. **"Demo Derby" Sessions** (Weekly, 30 minutes):
   - Rapid-fire 3-minute presentations of newly displayed work
   - Q&A focus on process and lessons learned rather than just outcomes
   - Explicit invitation for others to build upon or adapt approaches
   - Document spontaneous collaboration agreements

2. **"Work-in-Progress Critiques"** (Bi-weekly, 45 minutes):
   - Architecture studio-style critique sessions adapted for software teams
   - Structured feedback protocol: observations, questions, suggestions
   - Focus on generative critique that improves work rather than just evaluation
   - Rotation of critique leadership to develop facilitation skills

3. **"Failure Archaeology"** (Monthly, 60 minutes):
   - Dedicated sessions for displaying and discussing failed experiments
   - Emphasis on learning extraction and knowledge preservation
   - Create "failure artifacts" that prevent repeating mistakes
   - Celebrate intelligent failures that advanced team understanding

*Technology-Enhanced Engagement:*

1. **Augmented Reality Integration**:
   - AR markers on physical displays that reveal digital layers when viewed through mobile apps
   - Historical progression viewing: see how work evolved over time through AR overlay
   - Hidden documentation: process notes, decision rationales, and context accessible via AR
   - Remote collaboration: distributed team members can leave AR comments on physical displays

2. **Social Network Integration**:
   - Internal social feeds highlighting display interactions and collaborations
   - Expertise discovery: connect people based on displayed work and demonstrated interests
   - Serendipity algorithms: suggest connections between seemingly unrelated displayed work
   - Knowledge graph building: automatic tagging and linking of displayed artifacts

**Content Guidelines:**

*Authentic Work-in-Progress:*
- **Messy middle documentation**: Sketches, failed prototypes, and iteration attempts
- **Decision archaeology**: Visible traces of why certain approaches were chosen or abandoned
- **Learning artifacts**: Documentation of what teams discovered during development
- **Process transparency**: Time-lapse photography, iteration sequences, and evolution narratives

*Balanced Information Architecture:*
- **Context setting**: Brief background on project goals and constraints
- **Current status**: Clear indication of what's complete, in-progress, or planned
- **Invitation to engage**: Specific questions or areas where team seeks input
- **Connection opportunities**: Explicit links to related work and collaboration possibilities

*Intellectual Property Considerations:*
- **Graduated disclosure**: Public displays focus on process and learning rather than proprietary details
- **Safe-to-share guidelines**: Clear criteria for what can be displayed without IP concerns
- **Anonymization techniques**: Methods for sharing learning without revealing sensitive information
- **Time-delayed displays**: Show work after IP protection or competitive advantages are secured

## Forces
- Work visibility vs. intellectual property concerns
- Polished display vs. authentic work-in-progress
- Dedicated display space vs. workspace efficiency
