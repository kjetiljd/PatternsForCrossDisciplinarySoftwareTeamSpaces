# Display of Work

## Summary
Leave prototypes and work-in-progress visible to invite curiosity and cross-pollination of ideas across teams.

## Context
Teams create valuable artifacts, prototypes, and work-in-progress that could inspire and inform other teams if made visible.

## Problem
When work is hidden away, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other's approaches and discover unexpected connections between projects. Empty display spaces signal that sharing work is not expected or valued.

## Solution
Create dedicated spaces for displaying current work, prototypes, and visual artifacts where team members can see and be inspired by each other's progress.

**Make work-in-progress visible:**
- Display boards, walls, and stands that invite teams to share current work
- Show authentic work-in-progress rather than only polished results
- Rotate displays regularly to keep content fresh and relevant
- Include process artifacts like sketches, notes, and iterative prototypes

**Create social proof through visibility:**
- When teams see others displaying work, they're more likely to participate
- Visible work creates beneficial traces that attract curiosity and collaboration
- Active displays signal that sharing knowledge is valued and expected
- Stories about how displayed work led to collaboration encourage more sharing

## Forces
- Work visibility vs. intellectual property concerns
- Polished display vs. authentic work-in-progress
- Dedicated display space vs. workspace efficiency
- Physical vs. digital display formats
- **Social proof effects**: Visible evidence of sharing encourages more teams to display their work
