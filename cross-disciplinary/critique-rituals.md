# Critique Rituals

## Summary
Regular open forum sessions for presenting work and receiving peer feedback to improve quality and foster learning.

## Context
Teams need structured opportunities to share their work and receive constructive feedback from peers to improve quality and learn from each other.

## Problem
Without regular critique sessions, teams miss opportunities to improve their work through peer feedback and fail to learn from each other's approaches.

## Solution
Establish regular critique sessions where teams present their work to peers and receive structured feedback in a supportive environment.

## Forces
- Structured feedback vs. informal discussion
- Psychological safety vs. honest critique
- Time investment vs. learning benefits
