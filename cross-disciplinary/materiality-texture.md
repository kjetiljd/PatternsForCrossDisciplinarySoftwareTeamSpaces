# Materiality and Texture

## Summary
Use different materials and textures to create inspiring spaces that help teams think creatively and feel comfortable.

## Context
Software teams work long hours on computers. Physical spaces with varied materials and textures can help them stay creative and connected to their environment.

## Problem
Bland, uniform environments can hurt creativity and well-being. Working only with digital tools can make people feel disconnected from the physical world.

## Solution
Add different materials, textures, and touchable elements to work spaces. Choose materials based on research. Map out where different textures work best. Plan for easy maintenance.

## Forces
- Sensory stimulation vs. distraction
- Maintenance requirements vs. textural variety
- Professional appearance vs. creative inspiration
- Cost of materials vs. environmental benefits
