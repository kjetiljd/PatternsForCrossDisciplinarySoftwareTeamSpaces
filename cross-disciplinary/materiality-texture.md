# Materiality and Texture

## Summary
Use varied materials and textures to create inspiring, tactile environments that stimulate creativity and provide sensory richness.

## Context
Software teams spend long hours in digital environments and can benefit from physical spaces that provide sensory variety and tactile inspiration.

## Problem
Sterile, monotonous environments can reduce creativity and well-being, while purely digital work can create a disconnect from physical materials and textures.

## Solution
Incorporate varied materials, textures, and tactile elements into work environments to create sensory richness and inspire creativity through evidence-based material selection, strategic sensory mapping, and sustainable maintenance practices.
