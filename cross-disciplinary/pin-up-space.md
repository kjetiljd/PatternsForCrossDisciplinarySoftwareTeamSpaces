# Pin-Up Space

## Summary
Dedicate walls for displaying design work and making the creative process visible. Support critique and collaboration through professional installation, systematic curation, and structured interaction protocols.

## Context
Teams need ways to display and discuss visual work, design concepts, and process artifacts. This helps get feedback and collaborative refinement. Pin-up spaces serve as both working walls for active critique and gallery walls for inspiration. They require careful balance between accessibility and presentation quality.

## Problem
Without dedicated display space, teams struggle to share visual work effectively. They miss opportunities for collaborative critique and improvement. Poorly designed pin-up spaces become cluttered, damage work, or fail to encourage meaningful interaction and feedback.

## Solution
Create professionally designed pin-up walls with systematic installation specifications, clear curation guidelines, and structured interaction protocols. These facilitate high-quality critique and collaborative refinement.

## Forces
- Display quality vs. ease of change
- Professional presentation vs. work-in-progress visibility
- Individual work vs. collaborative critique
- Permanent installation vs. flexible use
