# Pin-Up Space

## Summary
Dedicate walls for displaying design work and making the creative process visible to support critique and collaboration.

## Context
Teams need ways to display and discuss visual work, design concepts, and process artifacts to facilitate feedback and collaborative refinement.

## Problem
Without dedicated display space, teams struggle to share visual work effectively and miss opportunities for collaborative critique and improvement.

## Solution
Provide dedicated wall space with appropriate lighting and mounting systems where teams can display work for review, critique, and inspiration.
