# Andon Cord & Stop-the-Line

## Summary
Enable any team member to halt work to address quality issues and create a culture of shared responsibility for quality.

## Context
Software teams need mechanisms to address quality issues quickly and create shared responsibility for maintaining high standards.

## Problem
When quality issues are ignored or passed along, they accumulate and create larger problems later, while team members may hesitate to raise concerns about quality.

## Solution
Establish cultural norms and mechanisms that enable any team member to stop work when quality issues are identified, ensuring immediate attention to problems.

## Forces
- Quality vs. delivery pressure
- Individual vs. collective responsibility
- Immediate fixes vs. systemic improvements
- Psychological safety vs. performance pressure
