# Modular Furniture and Reconfigurability

## Summary
Use movable furniture and flexible power to quickly adapt spaces for new projects and changing team needs.

## Context
Software teams need to reconfigure their workspace for different activities like brainstorming, focused work, presentations, and collaborative programming.

## Problem
Fixed furniture layouts can't adapt to different work modes and team activities, reducing the effectiveness of different types of work.

## Solution
Provide modular, movable furniture with flexible power and data connections that allow teams to quickly reconfigure their space for different activities.

**Pair Programming Focus:**
- Wide, straight-edged desks (minimum 160Ã—80 cm) that can be combined or separated
- Bench-style workstations without corner obstructions to welcome collaboration partners
- Mobile workstations on wheels allowing dynamic reconfiguration for pairing or solo work
- Dual monitor arms and cable management supporting two-person workstation setups

**Collaborative Infrastructure:**
- Traveling whiteboards and pinboards on wheels that move to wherever teams need them
- Mobile acoustic panels that can create temporary boundaries around collaboration areas
- Modular seating that accommodates different group sizes and work modes
- Rolling tool carts with shared equipment accessible to any team member

**Flexible Power and Connectivity:**
- Overhead power delivery or floor-based flexible connections
- Wireless network infrastructure reducing cable dependencies
- USB and device charging stations integrated into mobile furniture
- Quick-disconnect power and data connections for rapid reconfiguration

## Forces
- Reconfiguration flexibility vs. setup overhead
- Furniture durability vs. mobility
- Cost of modular systems vs. benefits of adaptability
- Standardization vs. customization

## Examples
- **Agile Offices:** Mobile workstations that can be recombined for pair programming or separated for focus work
- **Modern Co-working Spaces:** Modular desk systems with traveling whiteboards and acoustic panels
- **Spotify Office Design:** Flexible furniture systems supporting rapid team reconfiguration
