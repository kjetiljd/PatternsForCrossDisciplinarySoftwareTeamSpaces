# Modular Furniture and Reconfigurability

## Summary
Use movable furniture and flexible power to quickly adapt spaces for new projects and changing team needs.

## Context
Software teams need to reconfigure their workspace for different activities like brainstorming, focused work, presentations, and collaborative programming.

## Problem
Fixed furniture layouts can't adapt to different work modes and team activities, reducing the effectiveness of different types of work.

## Solution
Provide modular, movable furniture with flexible power and data connections that allow teams to quickly reconfigure their space for different activities.

## Forces
- Reconfiguration flexibility vs. setup overhead
- Furniture durability vs. mobility
- Cost of modular systems vs. benefits of adaptability
- Standardization vs. customization
