# Kaizen Corner

## Summary
Create visible spaces for tracking continuous improvement efforts and celebrating incremental progress toward better practices.

## Context
Teams need ways to track and celebrate continuous improvement efforts while making progress visible to maintain motivation and accountability.

## Problem
Without visible tracking of improvement efforts, teams lose momentum on continuous improvement initiatives and miss opportunities to celebrate progress.

## Solution
Establish dedicated spaces for displaying improvement goals, tracking progress, and celebrating achievements in continuous improvement efforts.

## Forces
- Public visibility vs. team privacy
- Formal tracking vs. organic improvement
- Individual vs. team improvements
