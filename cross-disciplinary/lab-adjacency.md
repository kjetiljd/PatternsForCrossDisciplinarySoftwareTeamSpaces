# Lab Adjacency

## Summary
Position related teams near each other to spark collaboration and knowledge sharing through proximity and osmotic communication.

## Context
Teams working on related technologies or serving similar domains can benefit from close physical proximity to enable spontaneous collaboration.

## Problem
Teams working on related problems but located far apart miss opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaborative problem-solving.

## Solution
Arrange teams with complementary skills or related work domains in adjacent spaces to maximize opportunities for informal collaboration and knowledge transfer.

## Forces
- Collaboration benefits vs. space constraints
- Related work domains vs. team autonomy
- Planned adjacency vs. organic team evolution
- Noise and interruption vs. knowledge sharing
