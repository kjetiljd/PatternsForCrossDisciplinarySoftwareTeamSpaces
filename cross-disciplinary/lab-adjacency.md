# Lab Adjacency

## Summary
Position related teams near each other to spark collaboration and knowledge sharing through proximity and osmotic communication.

## Context
Teams working on related technologies or serving similar domains can benefit from close physical proximity to enable spontaneous collaboration.

## Problem
Teams working on related problems but located far apart miss opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaborative problem-solving.

## Solution
Arrange teams with complementary skills or related work domains in adjacent spaces using evidence-based spatial arrangements, systematic measurement methods, and hybrid work adaptations to maximize opportunities for informal collaboration and knowledge transfer.

### Optimal Spatial Arrangements

**Research-Based Adjacency Principles:**

*Distance and Interaction Research Findings:*
- **Propinquity Effect:** Interaction probability decreases exponentially with distance
- **Allen Curve:** Communication frequency drops dramatically beyond 50-meter separation
- **Critical Thresholds:** 
  - <10 meters: Daily informal interaction (>80% probability)
  - 10-30 meters: Weekly interaction (40-60% probability)  
  - 30-50 meters: Monthly interaction (20-30% probability)
  - >50 meters: Rare interaction (<10% probability)

*Optimal Adjacency Configurations:*

**High-Synergy Adjacencies (Direct Border Sharing):**
- **Complementary Technical Stacks:** Frontend/Backend, DevOps/Development, QA/Development
- **Sequential Workflows:** Design → Development → Testing → Deployment
- **Shared Customer Domains:** Same product lines, user segments, or business domains
- **Knowledge Dependencies:** Teams that frequently need each other's expertise
- **Resource Sharing:** Teams using common tools, datasets, or infrastructure

**Medium-Synergy Adjacencies (Within 30 meters):**

- **Future Collaboration:** Teams with potential but undefined collaboration
- **Administrative Coordination:** Teams that share administrative but not technical dependencies
- **Social Networking:** Teams that benefit from informal relationship building
