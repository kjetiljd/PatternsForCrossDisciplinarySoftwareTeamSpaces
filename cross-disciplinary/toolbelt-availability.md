# Toolbelt Availability

## Summary
Provide shared gadgets and tools that any team can experiment with to encourage innovation and cross-domain learning.

## Context
Teams can benefit from experimenting with tools and technologies outside their core domain to inspire new approaches and solutions.

## Problem
Teams often can't justify purchasing specialized tools for occasional experiments, limiting their ability to explore new approaches and learn from other domains.

## Solution
Maintain a shared collection of tools, gadgets, and equipment that teams can borrow for experiments and prototyping activities.

## Forces
- Tool access vs. maintenance overhead
- Specialized tools vs. general-purpose equipment
- Sharing coordination vs. immediate availability
- Cost of tools vs. experimentation benefits
