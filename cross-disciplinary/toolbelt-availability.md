# Toolbelt Availability

## Summary
Provide shared gadgets and tools that any team can experiment with to encourage innovation and cross-domain learning through systematic inventory management, discovery mechanisms, and usage protocols.

## Context
Teams can benefit from experimenting with tools and technologies outside their core domain to inspire new approaches and solutions. Success requires balancing tool accessibility with maintenance responsibility, discovery mechanisms with inventory control, and individual exploration with collective stewardship.

## Problem
Teams often can't justify purchasing specialized tools for occasional experiments, limiting their ability to explore new approaches and learn from other domains. Without systematic management, tool libraries become chaotic, items disappear, and teams avoid using shared resources due to difficulty finding and accessing what they need.

## Solution
Establish a comprehensive tool library with systematic inventory management, intuitive discovery mechanisms, and clear usage protocols that maximize experimentation while maintaining tool accessibility and organizational sustainability.
