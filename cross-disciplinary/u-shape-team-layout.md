# U-Shape Team Layout

## Summary
Arrange teams in circular or U-shaped seating for fluid communication and equal participation in team activities.

## Context
Teams need seating arrangements that enable effective communication and ensure all team members can participate equally in discussions and collaborative work.

## Problem
Linear seating arrangements can create communication barriers and exclude some team members from discussions, while scattered seating makes group coordination difficult.

## Solution
Arrange team seating in U-shaped or circular configurations that enable eye contact and equal participation for all team members.

## Forces
- Equal participation vs. space efficiency
- Flexibility vs. optimal communication layout
- Individual workspace vs. team configuration
- Acoustic considerations vs. visual communication
