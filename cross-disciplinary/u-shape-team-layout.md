# U-Shape Team Layout

## Summary
Arrange team workstations in U-shaped configurations with people sitting inside the U facing outward, enabling easy mobility and collaboration while maintaining individual focus.

## Context
Teams need seating arrangements that enable effective communication and ensure all team members can participate equally in discussions and collaborative work.

## Problem
Linear seating arrangements can create communication barriers and exclude some team members from discussions, while scattered seating makes group coordination difficult.

## Solution
Arrange team workstations in U-shaped configurations with people sitting inside the U facing outward toward their screens, while using wheeled chairs for easy collaboration.

**Software Team Implementation:**
- **Perimeter workstations**: Individual desks positioned around room perimeter facing walls, allowing easy swivel to face team center
- **Central collaboration space**: Open area or shared table at the center of the U-shape for team gatherings
- **Pair programming pods**: Adjacent workstations within the U-shape that can function as pairing stations
- **Mobile collaboration**: Office chairs with wheels allow easy scooting between workstations for pair programming
- **Monitor visibility**: Screens for easily showing others, with easy chair mobility for collaboration

**Communication Optimization:**
- **Easy mobility**: Team members can quickly wheel their chairs to collaborate at any workstation
- **Peripheral awareness**: While facing outward, team members maintain awareness of teammates in their peripheral vision
- **Quick pivoting**: Simple chair turn allows instant face-to-face communication when needed
- **Central meeting point**: Open center of U contains gathering space for stand-ups and team discussions

**Flexible Configuration:**
- **Modular implementation**: Wide desks at right angles forming corners of the U-shape
- **Breakaway options**: Adjacent quiet spaces or privacy screens for concentrated individual work
- **Scalable design**: U-shape can accommodate 4-6 team members comfortably, perhaps doubling if needed for shorter paring sessions on wide desk-workstations
- **Activity zones**: Different areas of the U can support different collaborations, e.g with a wall-mounted screen at the bottom of the U for software teaming sessions  

## Forces
- Equal participation vs. space efficiency
- Flexibility vs. optimal communication layout
- Individual workspace vs. team configuration
- Acoustic considerations vs. visual communication

## Examples
- **Software Development Teams:** Teams using U-shaped desk arrangements report improved screen visibility and effortless communication
