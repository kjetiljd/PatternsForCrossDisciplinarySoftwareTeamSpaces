# U-Shape Team Layout

## Summary
Arrange teams in circular or U-shaped seating for fluid communication and equal participation in team activities.

## Context
Teams need seating arrangements that enable effective communication and ensure all team members can participate equally in discussions and collaborative work.

## Problem
Linear seating arrangements can create communication barriers and exclude some team members from discussions, while scattered seating makes group coordination difficult.

## Solution
Arrange team seating in U-shaped or circular configurations that enable eye contact and equal participation for all team members.

**Software Team Implementation:**
- **Perimeter workstations**: Individual desks positioned around room perimeter facing walls, allowing easy swivel to face team center
- **Central collaboration space**: Open area or shared table at the center of the U-shape for team gatherings
- **Pair programming pods**: Adjacent workstations within the U-shape that can function as pairing stations
- **Monitor visibility**: Screens positioned to be visible from center area for quick discussions and code sharing

**Communication Optimization:**
- **"Everyone can see everyone" effect**: Layout ensures line-of-sight between all team members
- **Swivel accessibility**: Team members can easily turn from individual work to face colleagues
- **Screen sharing**: Monitor placement allows others to glance at work for spontaneous collaboration
- **Central meeting point**: Open end of U contains gathering space for stand-ups and team discussions

**Flexible Configuration:**
- **Modular implementation**: Wide desks at right angles forming corners of the U-shape
- **Breakaway options**: Adjacent quiet spaces or privacy screens for concentrated individual work
- **Scalable design**: U-shape can accommodate 3-8 team members comfortably
- **Activity zones**: Different areas of the U can support different collaboration intensities

## Forces
- Equal participation vs. space efficiency
- Flexibility vs. optimal communication layout
- Individual workspace vs. team configuration
- Acoustic considerations vs. visual communication

## Examples
- **Software Development Teams:** Teams using U-shaped desk arrangements report improved screen visibility and effortless communication
- **Control Room Design:** Mission-critical environments where everyone must see everyone for coordinated responses
- **Collaborative Classrooms:** Educational settings optimized for group discussion and peer interaction
