# Poster Sessions

## Summary
Create demo walls and science-fair style showcases for informal feedback and cross-team knowledge sharing.

## Context
Teams need ways to share their work progress and insights with other teams. They want to avoid formal presentations or lengthy meetings.

## Problem
Without visible showcases of work, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other. They also miss chances to get feedback and discover collaboration opportunities.

## Solution
Establish regular poster sessions where teams display their work, prototypes, and findings. Use structured format templates, digital/physical integration, and facilitation techniques. These maximize knowledge transfer and cross-team collaboration.
