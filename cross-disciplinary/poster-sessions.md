# Poster Sessions

## Summary
Create demo walls and science-fair style showcases for informal feedback and cross-team knowledge sharing.

## Context
Teams need ways to share their work progress and insights with other teams without requiring formal presentations or lengthy meetings.

## Problem
Without visible showcases of work, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other, get feedback, and discover collaboration opportunities.

## Solution
Establish regular poster sessions where teams display their work, prototypes, and findings on walls or displays, allowing others to browse and provide informal feedback.

## Forces
- Formal vs. informal knowledge sharing
- Prepared presentations vs. work-in-progress sharing
- Time investment vs. learning opportunities
- Physical vs. digital display formats
