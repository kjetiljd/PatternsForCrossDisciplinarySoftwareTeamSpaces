# Shared Equipment Core

## Summary
Centralize specialized tools and equipment that multiple teams can use, creating natural gathering points for knowledge sharing and collaboration.

## Context
Organizations with multiple teams that occasionally need specialized equipment or tools but can't justify individual ownership.

## Problem
Teams work in isolation and miss opportunities for cross-pollination. Expensive specialized equipment sits unused most of the time when owned by individual teams.

## Solution
Create shared equipment cores:
- **Centralized location**: Place specialized tools in accessible common areas
- **Multiple team access**: Design for use by various teams and disciplines
- **Knowledge sharing**: Equipment areas become natural places for informal learning
- **Booking system**: Simple reservation system for high-demand items
- **Maintenance shared**: Distribute care and maintenance responsibility

Examples of shared equipment:
- UX research lab with eye-tracking, usability testing setup
- Hardware prototyping area with 3D printers, electronics
- Video/audio recording studio for demos and presentations
- VR/AR headsets and development rigs
- Specialized testing devices

## Forces
- Specialized equipment is expensive and underutilized by single teams
- Learning happens through observation and informal interaction
- Teams need exposure to tools they might not consider
- Shared resources require coordination and maintenance
- Physical proximity encourages knowledge transfer

## Examples
- Research labs with shared instrument cores
- Maker spaces with communal tool libraries
- Corporate innovation labs with rotating equipment access
- University fab labs serving multiple departments
