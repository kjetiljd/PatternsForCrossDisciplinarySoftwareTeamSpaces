# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains research and documentation for a pattern language focused on cross-disciplinary software product team spaces. The project bridges architecture, organizational psychology, software engineering, interior design, product management, and epistemology to create effective physical and organizational environments for software teams.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as a documentation-focused research project with the following structure:

### Core Research Files
Located in the `research/` folder (immutable):
- **research/Introduction.md**: Project overview, scope, methodology, team structure, and deliverables
- **research/Initial Research.md**: Focused exploration of patterns for small autonomous teams and workspace design
- **research/Foundational Research.md**: Comprehensive research compendium covering architectural/spatial patterns, organizational patterns, cross-disciplinary inspirations, temporal patterns, annotated bibliography, gap analysis, and meta-patterns
- **research/Additional Research.md**: High-performance team patterns for hybrid-first product organizations, incorporating insights from Team Topologies, FAST Agile, and recent research on fluid teaming, stream-aligned teams, and enabling/platform team structures

### Pattern Language Implementation
- **Pattern-Index.md**: Categorized index of all 50+ patterns with descriptive one-liners and links to individual pattern pages
- **architectural-spatial/**: Physical space design patterns (macro and micro-scale)
- **organizational/**: Team structure, process, and hybrid work patterns
- **cross-disciplinary/**: Patterns borrowed from research labs, maker spaces, studios, and manufacturing
- **temporal/**: Time-based rhythms, rituals, and cadence patterns
- **meta-patterns/**: Overarching themes and principles that tie pattern groups together

## Key Concepts

### Pattern Categories
1. **Architectural/Spatial Patterns**: From macro-level (building layout, team clusters) to micro-level (room types, furniture, environmental factors)
2. **Organizational Patterns**: Structures supporting aligned autonomy among software teams
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Patterns**: Lessons from research labs, maker spaces, architectural ateliers, and manufacturing cells
4. **Temporal Patterns**: Rhythms, flow, and ritual patterns that influence space and culture

### Core Principles
- **Aligned Autonomy**: Teams operate independently while maintaining organizational alignment
- **Hybrid-First**: All patterns account for hybrid work as the norm, not pure co-location
- **Norwegian Compliance**: Adherence to Norwegian building codes (daylight access, accessibility, indoor climate)
- **Human-Centric Design**: Prioritizing psychological safety, well-being, and team effectiveness

## Research Methodology

This is a literature-based research project that:
- Synthesizes existing patterns from Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language" and other architectural sources
- Incorporates modern agile/DevOps practices and case studies from tech companies
- Includes cross-domain analogies from non-software fields
- Identifies gaps in current pattern literature for hybrid/distributed teams
- Proposes new patterns and meta-patterns for contemporary software team environments

## Key Sources Referenced

- Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language" and related works
- Agile methodologies (XP, Scrum, Spotify model)
- Case studies from Google, Amazon, Basecamp, GitLab
- Remote work research and hybrid team practices
- Organizational psychology and team effectiveness research

## Working with This Repository

### File Organization
- All content is in Markdown format
- Research is structured thematically with clear sections and subsections
- Each pattern includes description, context, problem, solution, forces, and supporting evidence
- Extensive cross-references between patterns and sources
- Pattern-Index.md serves as the main navigation hub for all patterns
- Individual pattern files follow consistent structure with title, summary, context, problem, solution, forces, examples, related patterns, and sources

### Content Development
- New patterns should follow the established format with clear description, context, and evidence
- Maintain academic rigor with proper citations and source attribution
- Consider both physical and organizational dimensions of team spaces
- Address hybrid work scenarios as the default case

### Quality Standards
- All patterns must be grounded in research or real-world case studies
- Maintain consistency with Norwegian building regulations where applicable
- Ensure cross-disciplinary perspective incorporating multiple domains
- Focus on mid-size organizations rather than large enterprise or tiny startup contexts

## Current Status

The repository contains comprehensive foundational research with 50+ documented patterns across multiple categories. The research phase is largely complete, and the pattern language has been implemented with:

### Completed Work
- **Pattern-Index.md**: Complete categorized index with all 50+ patterns
- **5 pattern categories**: Architectural/Spatial, Organizational, Cross-Disciplinary, Temporal, and Meta-Patterns
- **50+ individual pattern pages**: Each with consistent structure and cross-references
- **Research foundation**: Extensive literature review and case study analysis

### Pattern Distribution
- **Architectural/Spatial**: 10 patterns covering macro and micro-scale space design
- **Organizational**: 15 patterns for team structure, autonomy, and coordination
- **Cross-Disciplinary**: 11 patterns from research labs, maker spaces, studios, and manufacturing
- **Temporal**: 9 patterns for rhythms, rituals, and time-based practices
- **Meta-Patterns**: 5 overarching themes that tie pattern groups together

### Identified Gaps for Future Development
- Hybrid-physical integration patterns
- Psychological safety in spatial design
- Mid-size organization scaling patterns
- Asynchronous collaboration rituals

This work serves as the foundation for a complete pattern language for cross-disciplinary software team spaces in the modern hybrid work environment. The pattern language is now ready for practical application and continued refinement based on real-world implementation.
