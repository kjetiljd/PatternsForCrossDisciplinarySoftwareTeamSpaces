# Illustration Style Description for Architectural Patterns

## Style
Hand-drawn line illustrations, mimicking pen or pencil sketching. Lines are slightly uneven to suggest human touch and avoid sterile precision. All elements are drawn in axonometric or simple top-down views, depending on what communicates the pattern most clearly.

## Detail Level
Minimalist. Only core spatial elements are included — walls, furniture, circulation paths, light sources. Non-essential detail is omitted to maintain clarity and consistency. Human figures may be included as outline silhouettes for scale and use-context.

## Color Scheme
Primarily monochrome (black or very dark gray on white background), with sparing use of pale accent colors from a fixed palette to highlight key elements:

- **Pale Ochre** (`#EAD8B7`): for natural surfaces like wood or shared tables  
- **Muted Teal** (`#B3D5C6`): to indicate soft zones or flexible seating  
- **Dusty Rose** (`#DDB8B1`): for highlighting interaction points or boundaries  
- **Stone Gray** (`#D3D3D3`): to subtly indicate background elements or fixed structures  

Use only one accent color per illustration, if any, and never fill large surfaces — restrict to strokes, outlines, or small shapes (e.g., cushions, arrows, zone markers).

## Annotations
IMPORTANT! No text in illustration unless explicitly asked for!
If asked for: Use handwritten or handwriting-style sans-serif text for labels (e.g., “shared screen”, “flexible seating”), with light leader lines. Font suggestion: something resembling “Architect’s Daughter” or “Patrick Hand”.

## Format and Proportions
Square or slightly landscape-oriented frames. Consistent scale across illustrations where applicable. All illustrations must fit cleanly into page layouts with accompanying pattern text, without dominating.

## Purpose and Emphasis
The drawing should visually reinforce the spatial logic or social intention of the pattern (e.g., visibility, flow, enclosure), not act as a precise blueprint. Clarity and repeatability of visual metaphor are prioritized over literal accuracy.

## Inspiration Sources
- Christopher Alexander’s *A Pattern Language* sketches  
- Japanese architectural sketchbooks  
- 1960s/70s educational diagrams  
- Contemporary sketchnotes and urban design charrettes  

Avoid gradients, shadows, 3D renderings, or digital gloss. The style should be suggestive, not declarative — inviting interpretation, not dictating form.
