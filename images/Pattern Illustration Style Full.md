Illustration Style Description for AI Prompting

⸻

General Style
	•	Medium: Hand-drawn architectural sketches using pencil or ink on a digital or textured paper background. Some incorporate gentle color washes with watercolor or digital tinting.
	•	Technique: Freehand-style drawing with visible imperfections, line variation, and organic flow. Lines show slight wavering and layering, evoking warmth and human touch.
	•	Perspective: Two-point or axonometric perspective with carefully observed proportions. Depth is enhanced with overlapping planes, not photorealistic shading.
	•	Shading: Light hatching, soft brush fills, or smudged pencil tones. Shadows are implied, diffuse, and kept minimal. Avoid hard edges or stark contrasts.
	•	Color (if used): Desaturated earth tones, warm grays, faded beige, and muted greens. Applied sparingly and softly, as washes or translucent fills.
	•	Materials & Surfaces: Indicated with subtle texture—wood grain suggested by direction lines, soft stone implied with gray blending. No sharp texture detail.

⸻

Atmospheric and Emotional Cues
	•	Softness: Achieved through loose, breathable linework, absence of rigid crosshatching, and subtle gradient transitions. Window views are hazy or tree-dappled.
	•	Warmth: Emphasized by warm color undertones, use of natural elements like plants or textured walls, and visible signs of comfort (stacked books, natural light, layered elements).
	•	Light & Air: Open compositions with tall glazing or voids. Light implied through brightness and openness of the scene rather than explicit rays or reflections.

⸻

Compositional Elements
	•	Architectural Emphasis: Structural clarity prioritized—beams, mullions, ceiling heights, openings. Walls are not monolithic but drawn with a sense of tactile surface.
	•	Surroundings: May include context hints like balcony railings, distant trees, soft shadows from nearby vegetation.

Prompt Style Template (for AI)

“Interior architectural sketch in hand-drawn style using pencil or black ink on white or lightly textured paper. Use two-point perspective with soft, breathable lines and minimal detail. Emphasize warmth through muted beige and gray watercolor washes, diffused shadows, and gentle textural hints on walls and floors. Include natural light through large windows, subtle tree silhouettes outside, and soft interior atmosphere. No furniture. Focus on spatial depth, softness, and emotional warmth. Style should evoke calm and tactile immediacy, like a concept sketch in an architect’s notebook.”
