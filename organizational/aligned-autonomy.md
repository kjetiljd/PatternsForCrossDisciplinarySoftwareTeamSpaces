# Aligned Autonomy

## Summary
Balance team independence with organizational alignment through enabling constraints and shared goals that guide autonomous decision-making.

## Context
Software teams need autonomy to respond quickly to changing requirements and make decisions about their work, while organizations need alignment to ensure teams work toward common goals.

## Problem
Too much autonomy can lead to fragmentation and teams working at cross-purposes, while too much control stifles innovation and responsiveness.

## Solution
Create enabling constraints and shared goals that provide direction without prescribing specific methods, allowing teams to self-organize within clear boundaries.

## Forces
- Team autonomy vs. organizational alignment
- Innovation vs. consistency
- Local optimization vs. global optimization
- Speed of decision-making vs. coordination overhead
