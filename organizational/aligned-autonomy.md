# Aligned Autonomy

## Summary
Balance team independence with company alignment. Use clear goals and guidance focused on outcomes. This lets teams decide "how" to work while staying aligned on "why" and "what."

## Context
Software teams need freedom to respond quickly to changes and make decisions about their work. Organizations need teams to work toward common goals. Modern research shows specific ways to balance these needs.

## Problem
Too much freedom can split teams apart and make them work against each other. Too much control stops innovation and slows response times. Traditional scaling often reduces team freedom. It adds detailed planning and extra coordination work.

## Solution
Create aligned freedom through several supporting practices:

**Leadership Focused on Results:**
- Measure outcomes and flow, not individual output
- Track lead time, quality metrics, and customer satisfaction
- Communicate clear intent (why and what) while leaving "how" to teams
- Focus on essential limits (compliance, security) rather than detailed methods

**Ongoing Knowledge Sharing:**
- Informal on-demand knowledge sharing between teams
- Regular internal sharing sessions and demos
- Communities of practice for cross-team learning
- Open decision-making and shared lessons learned

**Shared Ownership:**
- Shared code ownership across teams for common components
- Teams can improve any part of the system they touch
- Open-source approach to internal modules and tools
- Quality and standards aligned through peer review

**Lean Experimentation:**
- Teams validate ideas against user metrics and business outcomes
- Mandate to find novel ways to reach agreed outcomes
- Regular experimentation with fast feedback loops
- Freedom to change direction based on evidence, not just build features

## Forces
- **Freedom vs. Alignment**: Teams need freedom while serving company purpose
- **Innovation vs. Consistency**: Encouraging creativity while maintaining standards
- **Local vs. Global**: Optimizing team effectiveness while serving broader goals
- **Speed vs. Coordination**: Fast decisions without splitting efforts
- **Trust vs. Control**: Empowering teams while ensuring accountability

## Further details

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Strategic unity**: Teams innovate while naturally working toward business goals
- **Less coordination work**: Less need for heavy sync meetings
- **Higher engagement**: Teams feel their work matters to the company mission
- **Faster adaptation**: Teams can respond to change without waiting for approval
- **Better quality**: Shared ownership and peer review raise standards

#### Negative
- **Requires discipline**: Teams must maintain communication and feedback practices
- **Needs trust**: Leadership must truly trust teams and avoid micromanaging
- **Risk of misalignment**: Teams may drift apart if communication fails
- **Complexity**: More complex than pure freedom or pure control approaches

### Examples
- **OKRs with team freedom**: Quarterly outcomes with team freedom on how to implement
- **Inner source practices**: Teams contribute to each other's codebases
- **Lean Startup at scale**: Teams run experiments while serving broader strategy
- **Communities of practice**: Cross-team knowledge sharing without hierarchy

### Measurement Framework

#### Autonomy Indicators (Team Level)
- **Decision Latency**: Time from "need to decide" to "decision implemented" (target: <48 hours for reversible decisions)
- **External Dependencies**: Percentage of team blockers that require outside approval (target: <20%)
- **Process Ownership**: Team's ability to modify their own ways of working (survey: 8+/10)
- **Technology Choices**: Freedom to select appropriate tools and approaches (survey: 7+/10)
- **Workload Control**: Team's ability to manage their own capacity and priorities (survey: 8+/10)

#### Alignment Indicators (Organizational Level)
- **Goal Coherence**: Teams can explain how their work connects to organizational outcomes (survey: 9+/10)
- **Strategic Contribution**: Measurable impact of team work on business metrics (quarterly review)
- **Cross-Team Consistency**: Similar approaches to similar problems across teams (audit)
- **Knowledge Flow**: Information sharing frequency and quality between teams (network analysis)
- **Collective Ownership**: Number of cross-team contributions to shared systems (monthly count)

#### Balance Indicators (System Level)
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Time spent in cross-team coordination meetings (target: <20% of total meeting time)
- **Innovation Rate**: New ideas implemented per team per quarter (target: 2-4 meaningful experiments)
- **Alignment Drift**: Frequency of teams working at cross-purposes (incident tracking)
- **Trust Index**: Leadership confidence in team decision-making + team confidence in organizational support (bi-annual survey)

#### Warning Signals (Course Correction Needed)
- **Autonomy Without Alignment**: Teams optimizing locally without considering broader impact
- **Alignment Without Autonomy**: Teams waiting for permission on routine decisions
- **Fragmentation**: Teams developing incompatible solutions to similar problems
- **Micromanagement Creep**: Increasing frequency of detailed oversight requests
- **Information Hoarding**: Teams not sharing learnings or reusable solutions
