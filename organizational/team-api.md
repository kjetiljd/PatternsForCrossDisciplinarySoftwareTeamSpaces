# Team API

## Summary
Treat each team like a service. Give each team a clear interface. Show what they own, how they like to communicate, their work methods, and their values. This is especially important for teams working from different locations.

## Context
Software teams need to work with other teams. But they often lack clear agreements about how to work together well. When teams work from different places, informal chats become impossible.

## Problem
When teams don't have clear interfaces, they waste time figuring out how to ask for help or who to contact. Working across teams creates bottlenecks and stress. People have to navigate unclear responsibilities and different ways of communicating.

## Solution
Each team creates a simple Team API document that includes:

**Core Information:**
- Team mission and what they own
- Current work and short-term plans
- Key services or skills the team provides
- What they depend on and which teams they connect to

**Communication Rules:**
- How they like to communicate (Slack, email, etc.)
- Working hours and when they're available for live collaboration
- How quickly they respond to different types of requests
- Who to contact for different issues (technical, product, support)

**How to Work Together:**
- How other teams can use the team's services
- Support and problem-solving procedures
- Meeting preferences and collaboration styles
- How to escalate urgent issues

## Forces
- **Independence vs. Coordination**: Teams need freedom while working smoothly with others
- **Flexibility vs. Predictability**: Balancing change with clear expectations
- **Formal vs. Informal**: Structured interfaces versus relationship-based coordination
- **Maintenance vs. Value**: Keeping APIs current without too much bureaucracy
- **Visibility vs. Mental Load**: Making information easy to find without overwhelming people

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster team coordination**: Clear interfaces save time spent figuring out how to work together
- **Less mental effort**: Standard format makes working with any team feel familiar
- **Better service quality**: Teams think about their impact and customer experience
- **More independence**: Clear boundaries help teams work on their own
- **Better growth**: New teams can quickly understand how the organization works

### Negative
- **Maintenance work**: Team APIs need regular updates to stay useful
- **Possible bureaucracy**: Risk of creating process for its own sake
- **Coordination complexity**: More teams mean more APIs to find and understand
- **Change management**: Managing changes to team boundaries and responsibilities

## Examples
- **Internal service catalog**: Searchable directory of all team APIs
- **Team dashboard**: Visual display of team mission, status, and contact info
- **Slack bot integration**: Automated answers to common team questions
- **Quarterly API reviews**: Regular updates to team interfaces and responsibilities

## Implementation
1. Create a standard Team API template for consistency
2. Set up a central place or dashboard for all Team APIs
3. Have teams create their Team API when they start
4. Schedule regular reviews and updates (quarterly or when major changes happen)
5. Add Team API information to daily workflow tools
6. Train teams on how to write effective, user-friendly APIs
