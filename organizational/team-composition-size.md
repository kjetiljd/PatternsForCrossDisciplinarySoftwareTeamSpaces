# Team Composition and Size

## Summary
Maintain stable, cross-functional teams of 5-9 people with complementary skills, diverse perspectives, and clear role coverage, optimized for communication effectiveness and collective capability.

## Context
Software product development requires teams that can function autonomously while maintaining high quality. Team composition affects communication patterns, decision-making speed, knowledge sharing, and overall effectiveness. The optimal team balances skill coverage, communication efficiency, and psychological diversity.

## Problem
**Size-related challenges:**
- **Teams too large** (10+ people): Communication overhead grows exponentially, coordination becomes complex, individual contribution decreases, social loafing increases
- **Teams too small** (3-4 people): Limited skill coverage, insufficient resilience when people are unavailable, lacks diversity of perspectives, higher bus factor risk

**Composition-related challenges:**
- **Missing critical skills**: Teams lack essential capabilities needed for autonomous operation
- **Homogeneous thinking**: Similar backgrounds and perspectives limit creativity and problem-solving effectiveness
- **Unclear role boundaries**: Team members' responsibilities overlap inefficiently or leave gaps in coverage
- **Unstable membership**: Frequent team changes prevent development of trust, shared context, and effective working relationships

## Solution
Form cross-functional teams optimized for both skill coverage and communication effectiveness, with explicit attention to diversity and role clarity.

**Optimal Team Size: 5-9 People**
- **Sweet spot: 6-7 people** for most product development teams
- **Minimum viable: 5 people** with essential skill coverage
- **Maximum effective: 9 people** before communication overhead becomes problematic
- **Communication channels**: Formula n(n-1)/2 means 6 people = 15 communication paths, 9 people = 36 paths

**Essential Skill Coverage Framework:**

### Core Technical Skills (3-5 people)
- **Full-stack development capability**: Team can handle frontend, backend, and data layer work
- **Testing and quality assurance**: Automated testing, manual testing, quality practices embedded in team
- **DevOps and deployment**: CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring, and operational concerns
- **Security awareness**: At least one team member with security mindset and practices

### Product and Design Skills (1-2 people)
- **Product ownership**: Understanding user needs, business requirements, prioritization
- **User experience design**: User research, interaction design, visual design capabilities  
- **Domain expertise**: Deep knowledge of the business domain or user problem space

### Collaborative and Support Skills (distributed across team)
- **Technical communication**: Writing, documentation, knowledge sharing
- **Facilitation and coordination**: Meeting facilitation, project coordination, stakeholder management
- **Mentoring and learning**: Capability development, onboarding, knowledge transfer

## Team Formation Strategies

*Specific approaches for assembling effective cross-functional teams that balance skills, personalities, and working styles.*

### Formation Process Framework

**Phase 1: Skills Assessment and Gap Analysis**
1. **Map required capabilities** against current team composition using skill coverage framework
2. **Identify critical gaps** that would prevent team autonomy or create single points of failure
3. **Assess skill overlap** to ensure redundancy in essential areas while avoiding excessive duplication
4. **Evaluate development potential** of existing team members to grow into needed roles

**Phase 2: People Selection and Matching**
1. **Individual skill assessment**: Technical capabilities, domain knowledge, collaborative skills
2. **Working style compatibility**: Communication preferences, decision-making approaches, conflict resolution styles
3. **Motivation and goal alignment**: Career interests, learning goals, commitment to team success
4. **Availability and stability**: Current commitments, anticipated changes, long-term availability

**Phase 3: Team Chemistry and Integration**
1. **Gradual integration**: Add new members one at a time when possible to preserve team dynamics
2. **Explicit norm setting**: Establish working agreements, communication protocols, decision-making processes
3. **Relationship building**: Structured activities to build trust and understanding between team members
4. **Capability mapping**: Document each member's strengths, interests, and development areas

### Practical Formation Approaches

**Strategy 1: Core Team Expansion**
- Start with 3-4 high-performing individuals who work well together
- Gradually add complementary skills and perspectives
- Maintain team culture while introducing new capabilities
- Best for: Stable organizations, mature product development

**Strategy 2: Skilled Individual Assembly**  
- Identify specific individuals with needed skills across the organization
- Bring together to form new team with explicit team formation process
- Invest heavily in relationship building and norm establishment
- Best for: New products, special projects, significant skill gaps

**Strategy 3: Organic Team Evolution**
- Allow teams to self-select and evolve based on project needs and interest
- Provide framework and coaching for effective team composition
- Support teams in recruiting needed skills from within organization
- Best for: Innovative environments, high-trust cultures, experienced teams

**Strategy 4: Hybrid Team Construction**
- Combine permanent core team (3-4 people) with rotating specialists
- Maintain stability while accessing specialized skills as needed
- Use clear protocols for integrating temporary members
- Best for: Variable project needs, scarce specialized skills

## Diversity Considerations for Team Effectiveness

*How diversity of background, experience, and thinking styles strengthens team performance and decision-making.*
