# Team Composition and Size

## Summary
Maintain stable, cross-functional teams small enough to be "fed by two pizzas" while ensuring all necessary skills are represented.

## Context
Software teams need to be large enough to have all necessary skills but small enough to maintain effective communication and coordination.

## Problem
Teams that are too large suffer from communication overhead and coordination problems, while teams that are too small lack necessary skills and resilience.

## Solution
Form teams of 5-9 people with complementary skills including development, testing, design, and product knowledge, keeping them stable over time to build working relationships.

## Forces
- Skill coverage vs. team size
- Communication efficiency vs. capability breadth
- Team stability vs. organizational flexibility
- Specialization vs. generalization
