# Team Composition and Size

## Summary
Maintain stable, cross-functional teams of 5-9 people with complementary skills, diverse perspectives, and clear role coverage, optimized for communication effectiveness and collective capability.

## Context
Software product development requires teams that can function autonomously while maintaining high quality. Team composition affects communication patterns, decision-making speed, knowledge sharing, and overall effectiveness. The optimal team balances skill coverage, communication efficiency, and psychological diversity.

## Problem
**Size-related challenges:**
- **Teams too large** (10+ people): Communication overhead grows exponentially, coordination becomes complex, individual contribution decreases, social loafing increases
- **Teams too small** (3-4 people): Limited skill coverage, insufficient resilience when people are unavailable, lacks diversity of perspectives, higher bus factor risk

**Composition-related challenges:**
- **Missing critical skills**: Teams lack essential capabilities needed for autonomous operation
- **Homogeneous thinking**: Similar backgrounds and perspectives limit creativity and problem-solving effectiveness
- **Unclear role boundaries**: Team members' responsibilities overlap inefficiently or leave gaps in coverage
- **Unstable membership**: Frequent team changes prevent development of trust, shared context, and effective working relationships

## Solution
Form cross-functional teams optimized for both skill coverage and communication effectiveness, with explicit attention to diversity and role clarity.

**Optimal Team Size: 5-9 People**
- **Sweet spot: 6-7 people** for most product development teams
- **Minimum viable: 5 people** with essential skill coverage
- **Maximum effective: 9 people** before communication overhead becomes problematic
- **Communication channels**: Formula n(n-1)/2 means 6 people = 15 communication paths, 9 people = 36 paths
