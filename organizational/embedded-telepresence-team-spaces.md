# Embedded Telepresence in Team Spaces

## Summary
Integrate always-ready, high-quality video conferencing technology directly into team collaboration areas to create seamless hybrid participation in meetings, pairing, and mob programming sessions.

## Context
Hybrid teams need to maintain cohesion and equal participation regardless of location. Traditional approaches treat video conferencing as a separate activity requiring booking conference rooms, leading to exclusion of remote members from spontaneous collaboration.

## Problem
Remote team members often become second-class participants in team activities because video conferencing is treated as an add-on rather than a core component of the workspace. Impromptu pairing sessions, stand-ups, and collaborative coding exclude remote colleagues who cannot easily "drop in" to the team's physical space.

## Solution
Embed telepresence technology directly into team collaboration areas with comprehensive technical specifications, optimized room layouts, and structured interaction protocols:

### Room Layout Guidelines

**Optimal Spatial Arrangements:**

*For Teams of 3-5 people:*

*For Mob Programming (8-12 people):*
- **Screen Placement:** Dual screens - one for code, one for remote participants
- **Seating Layout:** Theater-style arrangement with clear sight lines
- **Table Configuration:** Tiered seating with laptop surfaces at each level
- **Camera Position:** Wide-angle capture from rear of room plus focused face camera

**Lighting Considerations:**
- **Natural Light:** Perpendicular to screen to minimize glare
- **Artificial Light:** 500-750 lux even illumination on faces

- **Bias Lighting:** LED strip behind screen to reduce eye strain

**Acoustic Treatment:**
- **Absorption:** 20-30% of wall surface with acoustic panels
- **Diffusion:** Avoid parallel reflective surfaces
- **Sound Masking:** White noise generation for privacy from adjacent areas
- **Isolation:** STC 45 minimum for walls separating from other spaces

### Interaction Protocols

**Equal Participation Guidelines:**

*Meeting Facilitation:*
- **Round-Robin Check-ins:** Always start with remote participants
- **Visual Cues:** Use hand signals visible to camera for speaking requests
- **Screen Sharing Protocol:** Remote participants present first, then local
- **Document Collaboration:** Shared digital workspace visible to all participants

*Spontaneous Collaboration:*
- **Drop-in Etiquette:** 30-second notification before joining ongoing session
- **Presence Indicators:** Visual/audio cues when remote colleague wants to participate
- **Context Sharing:** Brief summary of current discussion for joining participants
- **Transition Protocols:** Clear signals when switching between local and hybrid modes

*Mob Programming Sessions:*
- **Driver Rotation:** Equal time slots for remote and local participants
- **Navigator Role:** Dedicated remote navigator for inclusive participation
- **Code Review:** Screen annotation tools for remote participants
- **Break Protocols:** Synchronized breaks every 25 minutes for all participants

**Daily Operations:**

**Cultural Integration:**

*Behavioral Norms:*
- **Eye Contact:** Look at camera when addressing remote participants
- **Artifact Sharing:** Hold up physical items toward camera for visibility
- **Whiteboard Usage:** Duplicate key points in shared digital workspace
- **Side Conversations:** Explicit inclusion of remote participants in informal discussions

*Feedback Loops:*
