# Embedded Telepresence in Team Spaces

## Summary
Integrate always-ready, high-quality video conferencing technology directly into team collaboration areas to create seamless hybrid participation in meetings, pairing, and mob programming sessions.

## Context
Hybrid teams need to maintain cohesion and equal participation regardless of location. Traditional approaches treat video conferencing as a separate activity requiring booking conference rooms, leading to exclusion of remote members from spontaneous collaboration.

## Problem
Remote team members often become second-class participants in team activities because video conferencing is treated as an add-on rather than a core component of the workspace. Impromptu pairing sessions, stand-ups, and collaborative coding exclude remote colleagues who cannot easily "drop in" to the team's physical space.

## Solution
Embed telepresence technology directly into team collaboration areas:

**Video Integration:**
- Large video screen (32" minimum) mounted permanently in team collaboration space
- Position screen at eye level within primary collaboration area
- Ensure remote participants are visible to all in-person team members
- High-quality camera with wide-angle view capturing the entire team area

**Audio Setup:**
- Professional-grade microphone array with noise cancellation
- Speaker system providing clear audio throughout the team space
- Echo cancellation to prevent feedback during discussions
- Individual microphones for larger mob programming sessions

**Physical Positioning:**
- Mount screen adjacent to pair programming workstations or mob programming corner
- Position camera to capture whiteboards, flip charts, and collaborative artifacts
- Smart whiteboard integration or dedicated camera for physical sketching
- Ensure screen visibility from all team seating positions

**Always-Ready Operation:**
- One-touch connection for instant team member participation
- Persistent team "room" that remote members can join throughout the day
- Integration with team's primary communication platform
- Low-latency connection for real-time collaboration

## Forces
- **Inclusion vs. Distraction:** Remote presence should feel natural without dominating the space
- **Spontaneity vs. Technology Complexity:** System must be simple enough for impromptu use
- **Visual Quality vs. Cost:** High-definition video requires investment in equipment and bandwidth
- **Privacy vs. Transparency:** Always-on systems raise concerns about surveillance and privacy

## Examples
- **GitLab:** Permanent video setups in team spaces enabling remote-first collaboration
- **Automattic:** Telepresence robots allowing remote workers to "walk around" offices
- **Modern Hybrid Offices:** Wall-mounted screens with integrated cameras in every team room
