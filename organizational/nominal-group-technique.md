# Nominal Group Technique

## Summary
Make better decisions by collecting individual opinions first. Then focus group meetings on areas where people disagree. This approach reduces bias and ensures all voices are heard.

## Context
Group decisions often fail because of social pressure. Loud people, bosses, or group thinking can silence different views. Teams need decisions that include everyone's input while using meeting time well.

## Problem
Group brainstorming often gets taken over by the loudest voices, first ideas, or pressure to agree. This creates poor decisions that miss the full range of expertise and viewpoints available.

## Solution
Collect individual opinions separately from group discussion. Gather input independently and anonymously before meetings. Use meeting time to focus on disagreements and different views instead of forcing fake agreement.

## Forces
- Individual Thinking vs. Group Dynamics - People think differently alone than in groups
- Different Views vs. Social Pressure - Need all viewpoints but groups push toward agreement
- Speed vs. Quality - Want quick decisions but need good input
- Disagreement vs. Comfort - Healthy disagreement improves decisions but feels uncomfortable

- **Small Decisions**: For low-impact choices, the process takes too much effort
- **Very Small Groups**: With under 4 people, direct discussion works better
- **Frequent Use**: Too much use causes participant fatigue and gaming - limit to 1-2 times per month
- **Technology Problems**: When people lack digital skills or reliable internet
