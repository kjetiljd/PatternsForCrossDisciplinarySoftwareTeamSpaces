# Nominal Group Technique

## Summary
Improve decision-making quality by gathering individual opinions independently before group discussion, reducing bias and ensuring diverse input while focusing meetings on meaningful disagreements.

## Context
Group decision-making often suffers from social dynamics where dominant personalities, hierarchical pressure, or groupthink suppress diverse viewpoints. Teams need to make decisions that incorporate everyone's perspectives while managing meeting time effectively.

## Problem
Traditional group brainstorming and decision-making can be dominated by the loudest voices, first ideas, or social pressure to conform. This leads to suboptimal decisions that don't reflect the full range of available expertise and perspectives.

## Solution
Separate the collection of individual opinions from group discussion by gathering input independently and anonymously before meetings. Use group time to focus on areas of disagreement and diverse perspectives rather than trying to achieve false consensus.

## Forces
- Individual Thinking vs. Group Dynamics - People think differently alone than in groups
- Diverse Perspectives vs. Social Pressure - Need all viewpoints but groups tend toward conformity
- Efficiency vs. Thoroughness - Want quick decisions but need quality input
- Disagreement vs. Alignment - Healthy disagreement improves decisions but feels uncomfortable

## Implementation
1. **Define the Objective**: Clearly specify what decision or input is needed from the group
2. **Independent Input**: Send questions to participants individually, requiring asynchronous responses
3. **Anonymous Collection**: Use tools like Microsoft Forms, Menti, or Mural to gather responses
4. **Synthesize Results**: Aggregate individual inputs and highlight agreements and disagreements
5. **Focused Discussion**: In group meeting, concentrate on areas of disagreement and differing perspectives
6. **Decision Outside Group Pressure**: Make final decisions independently of immediate group dynamics
7. **Accept Disagreement**: Recognize that disagreement is natural and doesn't require unanimous consensus

## Examples
**Product Roadmap Prioritization:**
- Independent Input: Team members individually rank potential features with rationale
- Synthesis: Product lead aggregates rankings and identifies divergent priorities
- Discussion: Meeting focuses only on features where rankings vary significantly
- Decision: Product trio makes final priority decisions considering all perspectives

**Technology Selection:**
- Independent Input: Engineers individually evaluate framework options against criteria
- Synthesis: Technical lead summarizes assessments and highlights different conclusions
- Discussion: Team explores reasons for different assessments and trade-offs
- Decision: Architecture team makes selection based on comprehensive input

**Team Process Changes:**
- Independent Input: Team members anonymously assess current process pain points
- Synthesis: Facilitator identifies common themes and unique perspectives
- Discussion: Focus on areas where experiences differ significantly
- Decision: Team lead implements changes addressing the most impactful issues
