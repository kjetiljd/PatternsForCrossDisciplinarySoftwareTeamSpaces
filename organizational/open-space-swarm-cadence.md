# Open Space Swarm Cadence

## Summary
Use Open Space Technology for continuous self-organization of work, where teams form ad-hoc swarms around tasks in short, rhythmic cycles.

## Context
Organizations with high uncertainty and many small, interdependent pieces of work benefit from rapid adaptation. Traditional sprint cycles may be too rigid for environments requiring continuous adjustment of who works on what.

## Problem
Fixed sprint cycles and static backlogs can lead to skill underutilization, overloaded teams, and reduced innovation. People desire autonomy to choose work that matches their skills and interests, while organizations need maximum adaptability and knowledge sharing.

## Solution
Implement continuous Open Space marketplace for work allocation:

- **Work item marketplace**: All work (stories, projects) are "thrown on the wall" for self-selection
- **Ad-hoc swarm formation**: People form spontaneous teams around chosen work items
- **Short cycle rhythm**: Fixed intervals (e.g. 2 days) for work completion
- **Regular reconvening**: Teams share progress and reform as needed each cycle
- **Self-organization**: Continuous emergence of who works on what based on interest and system needs

## Forces
- **Uncertainty vs. Planning**: High uncertainty environments need flexibility over detailed planning
- **Skill utilization vs. Team stability**: Balancing optimal skill use with team cohesion
- **Innovation vs. Control**: Encouraging innovation while maintaining coordination
- **Individual autonomy vs. System needs**: Allowing choice while serving organizational goals

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid adaptation**: Continuous adjustment to changing needs and priorities
- **Knowledge spreading**: Rotation through different problem domains increases learning
- **High motivation**: Self-selection boosts ownership and engagement
- **Resilience**: No single points of failure as people can swarm on critical issues
- **Innovation**: "Near the border of chaos" operation can yield spontaneous order

### Negative
- **Potential confusion**: May feel unstable without proper facilitation
- **Lack of ownership**: Risk of reduced long-term accountability for outcomes
- **Cultural requirements**: Demands mature, self-managing (Teal) organizational culture
- **Coordination overhead**: Requires skilled facilitation to avoid thrashing

## Examples
- **FAST Agile**: 2-day swarm cycles with Open Space reformation
- **Spotify Engineering**: Guild-based swarming on technical challenges
- **Netflix**: Freedom and responsibility culture enabling organic team formation

## Implementation
1. Train facilitators in Open Space Technology
2. Create clear work item format and visibility
3. Establish regular cycle rhythm (daily or multi-day)
4. Develop skills in self-organization and conflict resolution
5. Ensure leadership provides vision and context, not detailed direction
