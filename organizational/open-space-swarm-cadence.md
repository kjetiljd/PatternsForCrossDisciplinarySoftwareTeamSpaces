# Open Space Swarm Cadence

## Summary
Use Open Space Technology for continuous self-organization of work. Teams form ad-hoc swarms around tasks in short, rhythmic cycles.

## Context
Organizations with high uncertainty and many small, connected pieces of work benefit from rapid adaptation. Traditional sprint cycles may be too rigid for environments requiring continuous adjustment of who works on what.

## Problem
Fixed sprint cycles and static backlogs can lead to poor skill use, overloaded teams, and reduced innovation. People want autonomy to choose work that matches their skills and interests. Organizations need maximum adaptability and knowledge sharing.

## Solution
Implement continuous Open Space marketplace for work allocation through structured facilitation and rhythmic cycles:

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Work item marketplace**: All work (stories, projects) are "thrown on the wall" for self-selection
- **Ad-hoc swarm formation**: People form spontaneous teams around chosen work items
- **Short cycle rhythm**: Fixed intervals (e.g. 2 days) for work completion
- **Regular reconvening**: Teams share progress and reform as needed each cycle
- **Self-organization**: Continuous emergence of who works on what based on interest and system needs

## Forces
- **Uncertainty vs. Planning**: High uncertainty environments need flexibility over detailed planning
- **Skill utilization vs. Team stability**: Balancing optimal skill use with team cohesion
- **Innovation vs. Control**: Encouraging innovation while maintaining coordination
- **Individual autonomy vs. System needs**: Allowing choice while serving organizational goals

### Facilitation Framework

**Opening Ceremony (15-20 minutes):**
1. **Marketplace Setup**: Display all available work items with clear descriptions and constraints
2. **Energy Check**: Quick pulse on team energy levels and capacity for different types of work
3. **Context Sharing**: Brief updates on organizational priorities and dependencies
4. **Open Space Invitation**: Facilitate work item selection using standard Open Space principles
   - Whoever comes is the right people
   - Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
   - When it starts is the right time
   - When it's over, it's over

**During Swarm Cycles:**
1. **Progress Indicators**: Visual tracking of swarm progress (Kanban boards, progress walls)
2. **Impediment Escalation**: Clear protocols for removing blockers quickly
3. **Cross-Swarm Coordination**: Lightweight synchronization between related swarms
4. **Individual Check-ins**: Brief daily touches with isolated or struggling participants

**Closing/Reconvening (20-30 minutes):**
1. **Harvest Session**: Each swarm shares progress, learnings, and next steps
2. **Work Item Status**: Update marketplace with completed, continued, or orphaned items
3. **Reflection Cycle**: Brief retrospective on swarm effectiveness and system improvements
4. **Preparation for Next Cycle**: Seed new work items and preview upcoming marketplace

### Work Item Formats

**Standard Work Item Template:**
```
Title: [Clear, Action-Oriented Name]
Size: [Small/Medium/Large - 1-2 day completion target]
Skills Needed: [Specific capabilities required]
Context: [Why this work matters now]
Definition of Done: [Clear completion criteria]
Dependencies: [What this connects to]
Constraints: [Time, resource, or technical limitations]
Champion: [Person who proposed/sponsors this work]
```

**Work Item Categories:**
- **Feature Swarms**: User-facing functionality requiring cross-functional collaboration
- **Technical Debt Swarms**: Code quality, architecture, or infrastructure improvements
- **Learning Swarms**: Exploration, research, or skill development initiatives
- **Crisis Swarms**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention and rapid response
- **Innovation Swarms**: Experimental ideas with high uncertainty but potential impact

**Work Item Sizing Guidelines:**
- **Small (1-2 people, 1-2 days)**: Bug fixes, minor enhancements, documentation updates
- **Medium (2-4 people, 2-3 days)**: Feature additions, architecture improvements, complex investigations
- **Large (4-6 people, 3-5 days)**: Major features, system redesigns, significant integrations

### Team Formation Exercises

**Pre-Swarm Formation Activities:**

1. **Skill Mapping Exercise (5 minutes)**: 
   - Each person writes their current skills and learning interests on sticky notes
   - Create a visual skill matrix on the wall for reference during swarm formation
   - Include both technical skills and domain knowledge areas

2. **Energy Declaration (3 minutes)**:
   - Participants indicate their energy level and preferred work style for the cycle
   - High energy: Complex problem-solving, innovation, challenging technical work
   - Medium energy: Collaborative work, code reviews, documentation
   - Low energy: Individual tasks, bug fixes, learning activities

3. **Interest Broadcasting (5 minutes)**:
   - People announce work areas they're excited about or want to avoid
   - Helps prevent assignment to demoralizing work and increases intrinsic motivation

**Swarm Formation Process:**

1. **Work Item Presentation (2 minutes per item)**:
   - Champion briefly presents each work item
   - Clarifies scope, skills needed, and expected outcomes
   - Answers questions about complexity and dependencies

2. **Silent Selection (3 minutes)**:
   - Participants silently review all work items
   - Use dot voting or similar method to indicate interest levels
   - Multiple interests allowed to enable negotiation

3. **Organic Team Formation (10-15 minutes)**:
   - People gravitate toward their preferred work items
   - Natural negotiation occurs for optimal team composition
   - Facilitator helps resolve conflicts and ensure skill coverage

4. **Team Composition Check**:
   - Ensure each swarm has necessary skills
   - Balance team sizes based on work complexity
   - Address any orphaned work items through renegotiation

**Swarm Formation Troubleshooting:**

- **Oversubscribed Work Items**: Use dot voting to gauge true interest levels, split into parallel swarms, or negotiate priorities
- **Undersubscribed Critical Work**: Champion advocates for importance, facilitator helps find volunteer participants, consider breaking into smaller items
- **Skill Gaps**: Identify opportunities for learning pairs, bring in external expertise, or defer work until skills are available
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use consent-based decision making, time-boxed discussion, or facilitator-mediated negotiation

**Team Bonding Micro-Practices:**

1. **Swarm Charter (5 minutes)**: Each new swarm quickly defines their working agreements
   - Communication preferences and frequency
   - Decision-making approach
   - How they'll handle obstacles and conflicts
   - Success metrics and celebration plans

2. **Role Clarity (3 minutes)**: Define any necessary roles without hierarchy
   - Technical lead for complex decisions
   - External communication liaison
   - Progress tracking coordinator
   - Quality assurance reviewer

3. **Working Session Kickoff**: Establish rhythm for the swarm cycle
   - Daily check-in time and format
   - Work session schedules and breaks
   - Progress sharing and help-seeking protocols

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Rapid adaptation**: Continuous adjustment to changing needs and priorities
- **Knowledge spreading**: Rotation through different problem domains increases learning
- **High motivation**: Self-selection boosts ownership and engagement
- **Resilience**: No single points of failure as people can swarm on critical issues
- **Innovation**: "Near the border of chaos" operation can yield spontaneous order

#### Negative
- **Potential confusion**: May feel unstable without proper facilitation
- **Lack of ownership**: Risk of reduced long-term accountability for outcomes
- **Cultural requirements**: Demands mature, self-managing (Teal) organizational culture
- **Coordination overhead**: Requires skilled facilitation to avoid thrashing
