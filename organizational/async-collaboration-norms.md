# Asynchronous Collaboration Norms

## Summary
Establish writing-first workflows and meeting protocols for distributed teams to enable effective collaboration across time zones and schedules.

## Context
Hybrid and distributed teams need to collaborate effectively despite being in different locations and time zones, requiring new approaches to communication and coordination.

## Problem
Synchronous collaboration requirements create bottlenecks for distributed teams and exclude team members who can't participate in real-time meetings.

## Solution
Establish norms for asynchronous communication, including writing-first decision-making, structured async meetings, and clear response time expectations.

## Forces
- Synchronous collaboration richness vs. asynchronous accessibility
- Decision-making speed vs. inclusive participation
- Communication overhead vs. thorough documentation
- Time zone constraints vs. team cohesion
