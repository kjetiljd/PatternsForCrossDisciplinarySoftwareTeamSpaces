# Swarm Reviews & Pairing

## Summary
Collective code reviews and pair/mob programming for knowledge sharing, quality improvement, and reducing knowledge silos. This is enhanced with regular cross-team review sessions and just-in-time swarming practices.

## Context
Software teams need to maintain code quality and share knowledge effectively. They must balance individual productivity with collective learning. Modern distributed teams require both synchronous collaboration and asynchronous review practices.

## Problem
Individual code reviews can be perfunctory and miss important issues. Knowledge silos create risks when team members are unavailable. Long review backlogs slow down delivery and reduce quality feedback.

## Solution
Combine collective code reviews, pair/mob programming, cross-team review sessions, and just-in-time swarming for comprehensive quality and knowledge sharing.

## Forces
- **Individual productivity vs. collective learning**: Balancing focused work with shared knowledge
- **Code quality vs. development speed**: Maintaining high standards without slowing delivery
- **Knowledge sharing vs. specialized expertise**: Spreading knowledge while respecting deep skills
- **Synchronous vs. asynchronous**: Optimizing for both real-time and time-shifted collaboration
- **Local vs. distributed**: Supporting both co-located and remote team members

## Further details

### Solution Details
**Mob/Ensemble Reviews:**
- Whole team reviews critical code or architecture together
- Use screen sharing and collaborative tools for remote participation
- Focus on learning and shared understanding, not just finding bugs
- Junior members learn by observation and participation

**Cross-Team Review Sessions:**
- Regular (e.g., mid-iteration) open forum presentations across teams
- Teams present work-in-progress for immediate feedback
- Creates "heartbeat" of review that catches issues early
- Spreads knowledge and prevents silos between teams

**Just-in-Time Swarming:**
- Use daily stand-ups to identify review needs
- Team swarms on important code reviews later that day
- Prevents long backlogs and maintains quality
- Aligns with "what's the best possible day we can have?" approach

**[Pair Programming](../architectural-spatial/pair-programming-workstations.md):**
- Continuous real-time review during code creation
- Knowledge sharing and quality improvement built into development process
- Reduces need for separate review cycles

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Higher code quality**: Multiple perspectives catch more issues than individual reviews
- **Knowledge sharing**: Information spreads naturally through collaborative practices
- **Reduced silos**: Cross-team reviews prevent knowledge isolation
- **Faster feedback**: Just-in-time swarming eliminates review backlogs
- **Learning culture**: Junior members learn through observation and participation

#### Negative
- **Time investment**: Requires significant time from multiple team members
- **Coordination overhead**: Scheduling and organizing swarm sessions takes effort
- **Potential burnout**: Too frequent swarming can exhaust team members
- **Tool dependency**: Remote swarming requires reliable collaboration technology

### Examples
- **FAST Agile**: 2-day swarm cycles with regular cross-team reviews
- **Mob programming**: Whole team programming sessions with continuous review
- **Virtual swarm rooms**: Always-on collaboration spaces for spontaneous reviews
- **Cross-team demo days**: Regular showcases that include peer review

### Implementation
1. Time-box swarm sessions to avoid meeting fatigue
2. Use collaborative tools for hybrid and remote participation
3. Focus on learning and improvement, not criticism
4. Integrate review needs into daily stand-up planning
5. Create virtual spaces for spontaneous collaboration
6. Balance swarming with individual focused work time
