# Swarm Reviews & Pairing

## Summary
Collective code reviews and pair/mob programming for knowledge sharing, quality improvement, and reducing knowledge silos.

## Context
Software teams need to maintain code quality and share knowledge effectively while balancing individual productivity with collective learning.

## Problem
Individual code reviews can be perfunctory and miss important issues, while knowledge silos create risks when team members are unavailable.

## Solution
Use collaborative practices like pair programming, mob programming, and swarm reviews where multiple team members actively participate in code creation and review.

## Forces
- Individual productivity vs. collective learning
- Code quality vs. development speed
- Knowledge sharing vs. specialized expertise
- Synchronous collaboration vs. asynchronous work
