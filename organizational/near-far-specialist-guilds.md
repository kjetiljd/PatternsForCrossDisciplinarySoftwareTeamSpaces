# Near/Far Specialist Guilds

## Summary
Blend embedded specialists with central guilds to share expertise. "Near" specialists work closely with delivery teams while "Far" specialists form communities of practice for deep knowledge sharing.

## Context
Cross-functional teams need access to specialized expertise (security, database, UX) but scarce experts cannot be fully embedded in every team. Pure centralization creates bottlenecks and slow hand-offs.

## Problem
Highly specialized roles create a dilemma: embedding experts in every team is inefficient and isolating, while centralizing all experts creates coordination delays and context switching overhead.

## Solution
Create a dual structure for specialist expertise:

**Near Specialists:**
- Embedded within or closely aligned to specific delivery teams
- Provide day-to-day guidance and implementation support
- Act as bridge between their team and the specialist community
- Participate in team planning, reviews, and daily work

**Far Specialists (Guild):**
- Central community focused on advancing the specialty domain
- Develop standards, tools, and best practices
- Share cutting-edge knowledge and innovations
- Provide backup support and knowledge continuity

## Forces
- **Expertise depth vs. Team integration**: Specialists need both community and application
- **Efficiency vs. Availability**: Balancing expert utilization with team access
- **Standardization vs. Customization**: Consistent practices versus team-specific needs
- **Knowledge sharing vs. Focus**: Spreading expertise without diluting specialist attention

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Timely expertise**: Teams get specialist input without delays
- **Continued learning**: Specialists stay current through guild participation
- **Resilience**: Guild provides backup when near specialists are unavailable
- **Consistency**: Standards and practices align across teams through guild coordination
- **Career development**: Specialists maintain professional community and growth

### Negative
- **Dual loyalty**: Specialists balance team and guild commitments
- **Coordination overhead**: Requires management of both embedded and guild relationships
- **Potential conflicts**: Team needs may conflict with guild standards
- **Resource allocation**: More complex than pure embedding or centralization

## Examples
- **Security champions**: Embedded security advocates connected to central security team
- **Data scientists**: Team-embedded analysts with connections to data science guild
- **UX designers**: Embedded designers participating in design system community

## Implementation
1. Identify critical specialties that need both embedding and community
2. Establish guild structures with clear purposes and rhythms
3. Define roles and expectations for near/far specialist relationships
4. Create communication channels between embedded specialists and guilds
5. Ensure guild activities add value rather than create bureaucracy
