# Near/Far Specialist Guilds

## Summary
Blend embedded specialists with central guilds to share expertise. "Near" specialists work closely with delivery teams. "Far" specialists form communities of practice for deep knowledge sharing.

## Context
Cross-functional teams need specialized expertise in security, database, and UX. However, organizations cannot fully embed scarce experts in every team. Pure centralization creates bottlenecks and slow hand-offs.

## Problem
Highly specialized roles create a dilemma. Organizations find embedding experts in every team inefficient and isolating. However, centralizing all experts creates coordination delays. It also creates context switching overhead.

## Solution
Create a dual structure for specialist expertise. Use evidence-based guild formation. Create structured knowledge sharing frameworks. Develop clear career progression paths. These elements bridge individual development with organizational knowledge.

**Near Specialists:**
- Embedded within or closely aligned to specific delivery teams
- Provide day-to-day guidance and implementation support
- Act as bridge between their team and the specialist community
- Participate in team planning, reviews, and daily work

**Far Specialists (Guild):**
- Central community focused on advancing the specialty domain
- Develop standards, tools, and best practices
- Share cutting-edge knowledge and innovations
- Provide backup support and knowledge continuity

## Forces
- **Expertise depth vs. Team integration**: Specialists need both community and application
- **Efficiency vs. Availability**: Balancing expert utilization with team access
- **Standardization vs. Customization**: Consistent practices versus team-specific needs
- **Knowledge sharing vs. Focus**: Spreading expertise without diluting specialist attention

#### Negative

- **Resource allocation**: More complex than pure embedding or centralization

### Examples

### Implementation Steps
1. Identify critical specialties that need both embedding and community
2. Establish guild structures with clear purposes and rhythms
3. Define roles and expectations for near/far specialist relationships
4. Create communication channels between embedded specialists and guilds
5. Ensure guild activities add value rather than create bureaucracy
