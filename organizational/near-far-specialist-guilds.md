# Near/Far Specialist Guilds

## Summary
Blend embedded specialists with central guilds to share expertise. "Near" specialists work closely with delivery teams while "Far" specialists form communities of practice for deep knowledge sharing.

## Context
Cross-functional teams need access to specialized expertise (security, database, UX) but scarce experts cannot be fully embedded in every team. Pure centralization creates bottlenecks and slow hand-offs.

## Problem
Highly specialized roles create a dilemma: embedding experts in every team is inefficient and isolating, while centralizing all experts creates coordination delays and context switching overhead.

## Solution
Create a sophisticated dual structure for specialist expertise using evidence-based guild formation, structured knowledge sharing frameworks, and clear career progression paths that bridge individual development with organizational knowledge management.

**Near Specialists:**
- Embedded within or closely aligned to specific delivery teams
- Provide day-to-day guidance and implementation support
- Act as bridge between their team and the specialist community
- Participate in team planning, reviews, and daily work

**Far Specialists (Guild):**
- Central community focused on advancing the specialty domain
- Develop standards, tools, and best practices
- Share cutting-edge knowledge and innovations
- Provide backup support and knowledge continuity
