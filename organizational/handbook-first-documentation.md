# Handbook First Documentation

## Summary
Create comprehensive, accessible documentation to enable asynchronous work and reduce dependency on synchronous knowledge transfer.

## Context
Hybrid and distributed teams need access to organizational knowledge and procedures without requiring real-time communication with subject matter experts.

## Problem
Undocumented processes and knowledge create bottlenecks when experts are unavailable, while poor documentation systems make it difficult to find and maintain information.

## Solution
Adopt a handbook-first approach where all important information is documented in accessible, searchable formats before being communicated through other channels.

## Forces
- Documentation effort vs. knowledge accessibility
- Maintaining currency vs. comprehensive coverage
- Standardization vs. contextual adaptation
- Searchability vs. narrative flow
