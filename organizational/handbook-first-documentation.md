# Handbook First Documentation

## Summary
Create comprehensive, accessible documentation to enable asynchronous work and reduce dependency on synchronous knowledge transfer.

## Context
Hybrid and distributed teams need access to organizational knowledge and procedures without requiring real-time communication with subject matter experts.

## Problem
Undocumented processes and knowledge create bottlenecks when experts are unavailable, while poor documentation systems make it difficult to find and maintain information.

## Solution
Adopt a handbook-first approach where all important information is documented in accessible, searchable formats before being communicated through other channels.

### Core Principles
- **Document first, discuss second**: Write down information before explaining it verbally
- **Single source of truth**: Avoid duplicating information across multiple locations
- **Accessibility priority**: Make information findable and understandable by all team members
- **Living documents**: Treat documentation as evolving artifacts that improve over time
- **Transparent evolution**: Make changes visible and track reasons for updates

### Information Architecture Guidelines

#### Hierarchical Structure Framework

**Level 1: Mission and Context**
- **Organization overview**: Mission, values, and strategic direction
- **Team structure**: Roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships  
- **Working principles**: How the organization operates and makes decisions
- **Cultural norms**: Behavioral expectations and communication styles

**Level 2: Operational Processes**
- **Core workflows**: Step-by-step guides for recurring processes
- **Decision frameworks**: How different types of decisions get made
- **Meeting structures**: Purpose, cadence, and facilitation of different meetings
- **Communication protocols**: When to use which channels and formats

**Level 3: Technical Knowledge**
- **System documentation**: Architecture, APIs, and technical specifications
- **Development practices**: Coding standards, review processes, deployment procedures
- **Tool usage**: How to use and configure team tools and platforms
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Common problems and their solutions

**Level 4: Tactical Information**
- **Project specifics**: Current initiatives, timelines, and deliverables
- **Contact information**: Who to reach for different types of questions
- **Resource locations**: Links to tools, systems, and external resources
- **Temporary policies**: Short-term procedures and special circumstances
