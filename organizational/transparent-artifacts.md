# Transparent Artifacts

## Summary
Make work progress visible through information displays and shared dashboards. These provide real-time visibility into team activities and system status.

## Context
Software teams need to see each other's work. This helps them coordinate well and find opportunities to collaborate or help each other.

## Problem
When work is invisible, team members miss opportunities to help each other. They may duplicate efforts or fail to coordinate dependencies well.

## Solution
Create visible displays of work progress, system status, and team metrics. Use dashboards, task boards, and information displays that everyone can see and understand.

## Forces
- Transparency vs. privacy
- Information overload vs. useful visibility
- Real-time updates vs. maintenance overhead
- Physical displays vs. digital accessibility
