# Transparent Artifacts

## Summary
Make work progress visible through information radiators and shared dashboards that provide real-time visibility into team activities and system status.

## Context
Software teams need visibility into each other's work to coordinate effectively and identify opportunities for collaboration or assistance.

## Problem
When work is invisible, team members miss opportunities to help each other, duplicate efforts, or fail to coordinate dependencies effectively.

## Solution
Create visible displays of work progress, system status, and team metrics using dashboards, task boards, and information radiators that everyone can see and understand.

## Forces
- Transparency vs. privacy
- Information overload vs. useful visibility
- Real-time updates vs. maintenance overhead
- Physical displays vs. digital accessibility
