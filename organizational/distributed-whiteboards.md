# Distributed Whiteboards

## Summary
Use shared visual workspaces to maintain democratic brainstorming and design sessions across distributed team members.

## Context
Distributed teams need to collaborate on visual design and brainstorming activities that traditionally require physical whiteboards and co-location. The tactile, immediate nature of physical whiteboarding - where multiple people can simultaneously draw, point, and gesture - is critical for creative collaboration, system design, and problem-solving.

## Problem
Without shared visual workspaces, distributed teams struggle to collaborate effectively on design tasks and brainstorming, leading to reduced participation and poorer outcomes. Remote participants often become passive observers in sessions where screen sharing replaces interactive collaboration. This creates a participation hierarchy where co-located team members dominate visual discussions.

## Solution
Implement shared digital whiteboarding tools and establish practices for inclusive visual collaboration that enable all team members to participate equally, regardless of their physical location.

- **Multiple Input Methods**: Support text, drawing, sticky notes, and image uploads
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensure tools work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect different communication styles and comfort levels with visual expression

**Session Structure Templates**
1. **Divergent Phase**: Individual idea generation (5-10 minutes)
2. **Convergent Phase**: Clustering and discussion (10-15 minutes)
3. **Prioritization**: Voting or ranking activities (5-10 minutes)
4. **Action Planning**: Next steps and ownership (5-10 minutes)

### Integration Approaches
