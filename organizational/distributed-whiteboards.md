# Distributed Whiteboards

## Summary
Use shared visual workspaces to maintain democratic brainstorming and design sessions across distributed team members.

## Context
Distributed teams need to collaborate on visual design and brainstorming activities that traditionally require physical whiteboards and co-location.

## Problem
Without shared visual workspaces, distributed teams struggle to collaborate effectively on design tasks and brainstorming, leading to reduced participation and poorer outcomes.

## Solution
Implement shared digital whiteboarding tools and establish practices for inclusive visual collaboration that enable all team members to participate equally.

## Forces
- Visual collaboration richness vs. tool complexity
- Simultaneous editing vs. coordination overhead
- Accessibility vs. feature completeness
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous visual work
