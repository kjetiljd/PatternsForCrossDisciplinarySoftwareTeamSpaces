# Self-Governing Teams

## Summary
Empower each product team to be a self-governing workgroup of roughly 5â€“12 people with autonomy over their internal organization, work style, and schedule.

## Context
Cross-functional product teams that need to move quickly and adapt to changing requirements without bureaucratic overhead.

## Problem
Traditional hierarchical structures create bottlenecks and reduce ownership. Teams become dependent on constant handoffs and external decisions.

## Solution
Create autonomous teams that:
- Are cross-functional (include all needed roles: design, dev, QA, domain experts)
- Have 5-12 people maximum for effective communication
- Control their own work style, schedule, and internal organization
- Own a clear mission or product area end-to-end
- Can make decisions without constant approval
- Are accountable for outcomes, not just outputs

## Forces
- Teams need autonomy to be responsive and innovative
- Cross-functional collaboration requires co-location of skills
- Large teams have communication overhead
- Accountability requires clear ownership
- Teams need alignment with organizational goals

## Examples
- Spotify's autonomous squads (though lessons learned about need for alignment)
- Amazon's "two pizza teams" rule
- Alexander's "Self-Governing Workshops and Offices" (Pattern 80)
- XP's "Whole Team" practice
