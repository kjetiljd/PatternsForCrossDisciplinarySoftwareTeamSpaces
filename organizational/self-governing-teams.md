# Self-Governing Teams

## Summary
Empower cross-functional teams of 5-12 people with autonomy over their work style and organization, supported by trust, clear boundaries, and emergent internal leadership roles.

## Context
Cross-functional product teams that need to move quickly and adapt to changing requirements without bureaucratic overhead. Modern research emphasizes the critical enablers of true autonomy.

## Problem
Traditional hierarchical structures create bottlenecks and reduce ownership. Teams become dependent on constant handoffs and external decisions, while managers fear losing control.

## Solution
Create autonomous teams that:
- **Right-sized**: 5-7 people optimal for dense communication and mutual adjustment
- **Cross-functional**: Include all needed roles (design, dev, QA, domain experts)
- **Emergent leadership**: Allow informal roles to emerge (mentor, coordinator, translator, champion)
- **Trust-enabled**: Management grants real authority and removes bureaucratic obstacles
- **Clear boundaries**: Own specific mission or product area end-to-end
- **Customer access**: Direct connection to users and decision-making power
- **Outcome accountability**: Responsible for results, not just outputs

**Internal Leadership Roles** (based on research by Hoda et al.):
- **Mentor**: Coaching agile practices and team development
- **Coordinator**: Aligning with external stakeholders and dependencies
- **Translator**: Bridging business and technical communication
- **Champion**: Advocating for team needs and removing obstacles
- **Promoter**: Educating customers and stakeholders about team capabilities

## Forces
- **Autonomy vs. Control**: Teams need freedom while managers need confidence
- **Size vs. Skills**: Dense communication requires small teams, but cross-functional needs drive size up
- **Trust vs. Risk**: Real autonomy requires management trust despite failure risks
- **Internal vs. External**: Self-organization needs both internal capability and external support
- **Alignment vs. Independence**: Teams need autonomy while serving organizational goals

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Higher ownership**: Teams take responsibility for outcomes, not just outputs
- **Faster decisions**: No waiting for approval or management intervention
- **Increased innovation**: Autonomy encourages experimentation and creativity
- **Better accountability**: Peer accountability often exceeds managerial oversight
- **Higher motivation**: People feel empowered and engaged in their work

### Negative
- **Requires maturity**: Teams need skills in self-organization and conflict resolution
- **Management discomfort**: Leaders must learn to trust and support rather than control
- **Potential misalignment**: Without proper boundaries, teams may drift from organizational goals
- **Scaling challenges**: Coordination between autonomous teams becomes more complex

## Examples
- **Spotify squads**: Autonomous teams with lessons learned about need for alignment
- **Amazon's two pizza teams**: Small, autonomous teams owning specific services
- **Alexander's self-governing workshops**: Physical spaces that enable team autonomy
- **XP whole teams**: Cross-functional teams with all necessary skills

## Implementation
1. Start with clear mission and boundary definition
2. Ensure teams have necessary skills and tools
3. Remove bureaucratic obstacles and dependencies
4. Train managers in servant leadership approaches
5. Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement
6. Allow informal leadership roles to emerge naturally
