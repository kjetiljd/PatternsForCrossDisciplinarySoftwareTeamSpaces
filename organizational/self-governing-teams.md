# Self-Governing Teams

## Summary
Empower cross-functional teams of 5-12 people with autonomy over their work style and organization, supported by trust, clear boundaries, and emergent internal leadership roles.

## Context
Cross-functional product teams that need to move quickly and adapt to changing requirements without bureaucratic overhead. Modern research emphasizes the critical enablers of true autonomy.

## Problem
Traditional hierarchical structures create bottlenecks and reduce ownership. Teams become dependent on constant handoffs and external decisions, while managers fear losing control.

## Solution
Create autonomous teams that:
- **Right-sized**: 5-7 people optimal for dense communication and mutual adjustment
- **Cross-functional**: Include all needed roles (design, dev, QA, domain experts)
- **Emergent leadership**: Allow informal roles to emerge (mentor, coordinator, translator, champion)
- **Trust-enabled**: Management grants real authority and removes bureaucratic obstacles
- **Clear boundaries**: Own specific mission or product area end-to-end
- **Customer access**: Direct connection to users and decision-making power
- **Outcome accountability**: Responsible for results, not just outputs
- **Conflict resolution capability**: Internal mechanisms for resolving disagreements and tensions

**Internal Leadership Roles** (based on research by Hoda et al.):
- **Mentor**: Coaching agile practices and team development
- **Coordinator**: Aligning with external stakeholders and dependencies
- **Translator**: Bridging business and technical communication
- **Champion**: Advocating for team needs and removing obstacles
- **Promoter**: Educating customers and stakeholders about team capabilities

**Conflict Resolution Mechanisms for Internal Tensions:**

*Teams need structured approaches to handle disagreements while preserving autonomy and relationships.*

**Framework for Team Conflict Resolution:**
1. **Direct Communication** (First 24-48 hours):
   - Encourage one-on-one conversation between affected parties
   - Use "I" statements and focus on behavior impact, not personality
   - Establish shared understanding of the actual problem vs. symptoms

2. **Team Facilitated Discussion** (If direct fails):
   - Team member (often the Mentor role) facilitates structured conversation
   - Use techniques like "Five Whys" to understand root causes
   - Focus on team agreements and shared goals as decision criteria

3. **External Perspective** (For persistent conflicts):
   - Invite coach or manager to facilitate (not decide)
   - Consider involving another self-governing team for outside perspective
   - Use retrospective format to explore systemic causes

**Common Conflict Scenarios & Approaches:**
- **Technical disagreements**: Use time-boxed prototypes or "disagree and commit" with defined evaluation criteria
- **Work style conflicts**: Establish explicit team working agreements and revisit during retrospectives
- **Priority disputes**: Return to customer outcomes and team mission as tiebreaker criteria
- **Performance concerns**: Address through peer feedback and clear role expectations
- **Resource allocation**: Use transparent decision-making criteria agreed by the whole team

**Escalation Boundaries:**
- Teams resolve conflicts that affect only internal functioning
- Escalate conflicts that impact other teams or organizational commitments
- Manager involvement focused on coaching and support, not decision-making
- HR involvement only for policy violations or harassment issues

## Forces
- **Autonomy vs. Control**: Teams need freedom while managers need confidence
- **Size vs. Skills**: Dense communication requires small teams, but cross-functional needs drive size up
- **Trust vs. Risk**: Real autonomy requires management trust despite failure risks
- **Internal vs. External**: Self-organization needs both internal capability and external support
- **Alignment vs. Independence**: Teams need autonomy while serving organizational goals

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Higher ownership**: Teams take responsibility for outcomes, not just outputs
- **Faster decisions**: No waiting for approval or management intervention
- **Increased innovation**: Autonomy encourages experimentation and creativity
- **Better accountability**: Peer accountability often exceeds managerial oversight
- **Higher motivation**: People feel empowered and engaged in their work

### Negative
- **Requires maturity**: Teams need skills in self-organization and conflict resolution
- **Management discomfort**: Leaders must learn to trust and support rather than control
- **Potential misalignment**: Without proper boundaries, teams may drift from organizational goals
- **Scaling challenges**: Coordination between autonomous teams becomes more complex

## Examples
- **Spotify squads**: Autonomous teams with lessons learned about need for alignment
- **Amazon's two pizza teams**: Small, autonomous teams owning specific services
- **Alexander's self-governing workshops**: Physical spaces that enable team autonomy
- **XP whole teams**: Cross-functional teams with all necessary skills
