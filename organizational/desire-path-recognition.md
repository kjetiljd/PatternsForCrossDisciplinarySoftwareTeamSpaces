# Desire Path Recognition

**Summary**: Observe natural patterns of team behavior and space usage before formalizing processes or layouts, allowing organic solutions to emerge.

## Context

Organizations often implement rigid processes and physical layouts based on theoretical models rather than observing how teams actually work. This can create friction between formal systems and natural workflows.

## Problem

When processes and spaces are designed without observing actual usage patterns, they may conflict with teams' natural work rhythms and collaboration needs. Forcing artificial structures can reduce efficiency and team satisfaction.

## Solution

**Follow the Finnish planning approach**: Wait to observe natural patterns before implementing formal structures. Like Finnish planners who wait for the first snowfall to see where people actually walk before installing pathways, observe how teams naturally organize their work and space usage.

**Observe before formalizing:**
- Track team communication patterns before designing meeting structures
- Watch how teams actually use spaces before finalizing layouts
- Notice which collaboration tools teams gravitate toward naturally
- Identify informal coordination mechanisms that emerge organically

**Recognize and support desire paths:**
- Document successful informal processes
- Create formal support for organically successful patterns
- Remove barriers to natural workflows
- Amplify what's already working rather than imposing new systems

## Forces

- **Efficiency seeking**: Teams naturally develop more efficient solutions through trial and error
- **Context sensitivity**: Local conditions create unique optimal solutions that can't be predetermined
- **Ownership**: Teams feel more invested in systems they helped create through use
- **Adaptation**: Natural patterns evolve with changing needs, while imposed systems resist change
- **Social proof**: When teams see their natural patterns validated, they refine and improve them

## Examples

**University campuses**: Many universities delay pathway construction to observe student movement patterns, creating more intuitive campus navigation.

**Software team communication**: Teams often develop informal check-in patterns that work better than scheduled meetings - recognizing and supporting these creates better coordination.

**Workspace usage**: Teams may naturally cluster certain types of work in specific areas - acknowledging these patterns can inform better space design.

**Agile ceremonies**: Successful agile teams often modify standard ceremonies to fit their context - these adaptations become team-specific process improvements.
