# Digital Campfires & Virtual Watercoolers

## Summary
Create informal virtual spaces for casual interaction and relationship building to maintain team cohesion in distributed environments.

## Context
Distributed teams miss the informal interactions and relationship-building opportunities that happen naturally in co-located environments.

## Problem
Without informal interaction opportunities, team members can become isolated and miss opportunities for knowledge sharing and relationship building.

## Solution
Establish virtual spaces and rituals that encourage informal interaction, such as virtual coffee chats, online game sessions, and persistent chat channels for non-work discussions.

## Forces
- Formal vs. informal communication
- Voluntary participation vs. team building needs
