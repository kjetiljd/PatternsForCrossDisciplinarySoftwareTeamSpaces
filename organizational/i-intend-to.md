# I Intend To

## Summary
Build ownership and alignment through intentional communication by clearly stating planned actions and rationale before taking them, creating opportunities for feedback and support.

## Context
Software teams need to move quickly while maintaining coordination. Team members often take actions that affect others without prior communication, leading to surprises, conflicts, or missed opportunities for collaboration.

## Problem
Silent execution creates misalignment, reduces learning opportunities, and can lead to duplicated or conflicting work. Teams struggle to balance individual initiative with collective awareness.

## Solution
Adopt "I intend to..." as a communication pattern where team members declare their planned actions, purpose, and expected outcomes before proceeding. This promotes transparency, accountability, and creates space for coaching or course correction.

## Forces
- Individual Autonomy vs. Team Coordination - People want to work independently but need alignment
- Speed vs. Consultation - Stopping to communicate may slow immediate action but prevents later conflicts
- Ownership vs. Micromanagement - Clear intent builds trust rather than requiring approval
- Proactive vs. Reactive Communication - Preventing problems through early communication

## Implementation
1. **State Intent Before Acting**: Communicate planned actions and rationale out loud or in writing
2. **Include Reasoning**: Explain why this action makes sense now
3. **Invite Feedback**: Encourage questions, concerns, or suggestions after stating intent
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Check that others heard and understood the plan
5. **Adjust if Needed**: Use feedback to refine or pause action as necessary
6. **Pair with Thinking Out Loud**: Share both reasoning and planning for maximum clarity

- **Timing Issues**: "I worry this might be too close to the release deadline for comfort."
- **Resource Conflicts**: "This overlaps with what Sarah is working on - have you two connected?"
- **Scope Concerns**: "This feels like it might be bigger than a one-person task."

## Escalation Protocols

### When Intent Meets Resistance
**Step 1: Understand the Concern**
- Listen actively to the feedback without defending
- Ask clarifying questions about specific concerns
- Acknowledge the validity of different perspectives

**Step 2: Collaborative Problem-Solving**
- Explore alternatives that address the concerns
- Adjust timeline, scope, or approach based on feedback
- Identify additional resources or coordination needed

**Step 3: Decision Point**
- If consensus emerges, proceed with modified plan
- If disagreement persists, escalate to team lead or appropriate decision-maker
- Document the decision and reasoning for future reference

### When Intent Receives No Response
**Immediate Actions:**
- Assume good faith - people might be busy or distracted
- Try a different communication channel or timing
- Directly ask specific people for their input if needed

**If Silence Continues:**
- Proceed with stated intent after reasonable waiting period (typically 24-48 hours)
- Document that intent was stated and when
- Be prepared to adjust course if concerns emerge later

### When Intent Creates Conflict
**De-escalation Approach:**
- Acknowledge the disagreement without taking sides
- Focus on shared goals and values
- Seek to understand underlying concerns and motivations
- Propose time-boxed discussion to resolve differences

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Bring in neutral facilitator if needed
- Use data and evidence to inform decisions
- Consider splitting the difference or trying both approaches
- Document the resolution process for future learning

## Advanced Patterns

### Compound Intent Statements
**Sequenced Actions:**
"I intend to first investigate the API performance issue, then create a proposal for optimization, and finally implement the solution if we agree on the approach."

**Conditional Intent:**
"I intend to proceed with the database migration this weekend, assuming the backup verification tests pass on Friday."

**Collaborative Intent:**
"I intend to work with the design team to create mockups for the new feature, with the goal of having something to review by next Wednesday."

### Intent in Different Contexts

**High-Stakes Decisions:**
- Include more stakeholders in the intent statement
- Allow longer response time for feedback
- Document the decision-making process more thoroughly
- Consider formal review processes

**Routine Actions:**
- Streamline the intent statement for efficiency
- Focus on coordination rather than permission
- Use asynchronous communication channels
- Batch similar intentions together

**Experimental Work:**
- Emphasize learning goals over specific outcomes
- Include failure criteria and learning checkpoints
- Plan for sharing results regardless of outcome
- Time-box the investigation or experiment

### Team-Level Intent Practices

**Sprint Planning:**
Teams can use "We intend to..." statements for sprint commitments, making team-level intentions visible to stakeholders.

**Retrospective Actions:**
"We intend to try pair programming for complex features this sprint to improve code quality and knowledge sharing."

**Cross-Team Coordination:**
"Our team intends to deprecate the old API by end of quarter, giving other teams time to migrate."

## Measuring Success

### Individual Level
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Reduction in rework due to misalignment
- **Feedback Quality**: Increase in helpful input received before starting work
- **Learning Opportunities**: Growth in skills through collaborative planning
- **Confidence**: Increased certainty about work direction and priorities

### Team Level
- **Transparency**: Improved visibility into team member priorities and plans
- **Collaboration**: More frequent and effective peer consultation
- **Alignment**: Better coordination between individual and team goals
- **Trust**: Increased confidence in team member decision-making

### Organizational Level
- **Coordination Overhead**: Reduced need for status meetings and check-ins
- **Innovation**: More experimentation due to transparent communication
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Increased cross-pollination of ideas and approaches
- **Adaptability**: Faster response to changing priorities and requirements

## Implementation Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Personal Practice**: Begin using intent statements in low-stakes situations
2. **Team Introduction**: Explain the pattern and its benefits during team meetings
3. **Modeling Behavior**: Team leads should demonstrate consistent use
4. **Gentle Reminders**: Encourage use without making it mandatory initially

### Building the Habit
- **Environmental Cues**: Add intent-sharing to existing routines like standups
- **Tool Integration**: Include intent statements in team chat or project management tools
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge when intent statements lead to better outcomes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives on communication effectiveness

### Common Pitfalls
- **Over-Consultation**: Avoid seeking permission for every small decision
- **Under-Communication**: Don't skip intent statements for significant actions
- **Defensive Responses**: Welcome feedback rather than defending initial plans
- **Inconsistent Practice**: Maintain the pattern even when under pressure

## Examples in Action

**Development Work:**
- "I intend to start working on the authentication service next, because I think we need to unblock the frontend team. Does anyone foresee any issues?"
- "I intend to refactor the payment processing module this afternoon since we've had three bugs there this week. Should I coordinate with anyone?"

**Architecture Decisions:**
- "I intend to create an ADR for the database migration approach, since this affects multiple teams. I'll share the draft by end of day."
- "I intend to spike the GraphQL integration this week to test our assumptions about client performance."

**Team Coordination:**
- "I intend to schedule a design review for the new feature next Tuesday, including the mobile team since they'll need to implement the client side."

**Problem Resolution:**
- "I intend to investigate the memory leak we've been seeing in production, starting with the most recent code changes."

**Process Improvement:**
- "I intend to propose a change to our deployment process based on the issues we had last week."
