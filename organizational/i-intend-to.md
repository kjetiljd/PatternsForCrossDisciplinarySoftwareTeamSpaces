# I Intend To

## Summary
Build ownership and alignment through intentional communication by clearly stating planned actions and rationale before taking them, creating opportunities for feedback and support.

## Context
Software teams need to move quickly while maintaining coordination. Team members often take actions that affect others without prior communication, leading to surprises, conflicts, or missed opportunities for collaboration.

## Problem
Silent execution creates misalignment, reduces learning opportunities, and can lead to duplicated or conflicting work. Teams struggle to balance individual initiative with collective awareness.

## Solution
Adopt "I intend to..." as a communication pattern where team members declare their planned actions, purpose, and expected outcomes before proceeding. This promotes transparency, accountability, and creates space for coaching or course correction.

## Forces
- Individual Autonomy vs. Team Coordination - People want to work independently but need alignment
- Speed vs. Consultation - Stopping to communicate may slow immediate action but prevents later conflicts
- Ownership vs. Micromanagement - Clear intent builds trust rather than requiring approval
- Proactive vs. Reactive Communication - Preventing problems through early communication

## Implementation
1. **State Intent Before Acting**: Communicate planned actions and rationale out loud or in writing
2. **Include Reasoning**: Explain why this action makes sense now
3. **Invite Feedback**: Encourage questions, concerns, or suggestions after stating intent
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Check that others heard and understood the plan
5. **Adjust if Needed**: Use feedback to refine or pause action as necessary
6. **Pair with Thinking Out Loud**: Share both reasoning and planning for maximum clarity

## Examples
**Development Work:**
- "I intend to start working on the authentication service next, because I think we need to unblock the frontend team. Does anyone foresee any issues?"
- "I intend to refactor the payment processing module this afternoon since we've had three bugs there this week. Should I coordinate with anyone?"

**Architecture Decisions:**
- "I intend to create an ADR for the database migration approach, since this affects multiple teams. I'll share the draft by end of day."
- "I intend to spike the GraphQL integration this week to test our assumptions about client performance."

**Team Coordination:**
- "I intend to schedule a design review for the new feature next Tuesday, including the mobile team since they'll need to implement the client side."
