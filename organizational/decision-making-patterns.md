# Decision-Making Patterns

## Summary
Use advice process and consent-based governance to enable distributed decision-making while maintaining quality and stakeholder input.

## Context
Software teams need to make many decisions quickly, but important decisions require input from stakeholders and domain experts to ensure quality outcomes.

## Problem
Centralized decision-making creates bottlenecks and slows down teams, while completely distributed decisions can lead to poor quality choices and lack of stakeholder buy-in.

## Solution
Implement advice process where decision-makers must seek input from affected parties and domain experts, combined with consent-based governance for team-level decisions.

## Forces
- Speed of decision-making vs. quality of decisions
- Individual accountability vs. collective wisdom
- Stakeholder involvement vs. decision-making efficiency
- Domain expertise vs. local knowledge
