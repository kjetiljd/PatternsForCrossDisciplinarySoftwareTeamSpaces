# Decision-Making Patterns

## Summary
Use advice process and consent-based governance to enable distributed decision-making while maintaining quality and stakeholder input, supported by frameworks that match decision processes to context and complexity.

## Context
Software teams need to make many decisions quickly, but important decisions require input from stakeholders and domain experts to ensure quality outcomes. Different types of decisions require different approaches based on their complexity, reversibility, and impact.

## Problem
Centralized decision-making creates bottlenecks and slows down teams, while completely distributed decisions can lead to poor quality choices and lack of stakeholder buy-in. Teams often apply the same decision process to all situations, either over-processing simple decisions or under-analyzing complex ones.

## Solution
Implement a multi-layered approach to decision-making:

1. **Advice Process**: Decision-makers must seek input from affected parties and domain experts before making decisions
2. **Consent-Based Governance**: Use consent rather than consensus for team-level decisions
3. **Context-Sensitive Frameworks**: Match decision processes to the type and complexity of the decision
4. **Transparent Documentation**: Record important decisions with rationale and consequences

## Forces
- Speed of decision-making vs. quality of decisions
- Individual accountability vs. collective wisdom
- Stakeholder involvement vs. decision-making efficiency
- Domain expertise vs. local knowledge
- Complexity vs. simplicity in decision processes
- Reversibility vs. permanence of choices

**Framework Matching Guide:**
- **Reversibility Assessment**: Use [One-Way vs Two-Way Door Decisions](one-way-two-way-door-decisions.md) to match process weight to reversibility
- **Complexity Assessment**: Apply [Cynefin-Based Decision Framework](cynefin-based-decision-framework.md) to choose appropriate approach
- **Evidence Gathering**: Use [Structured Experiments](structured-experiments.md) when uncertainty is high
- **Group Input**: Apply [Nominal Group Technique](nominal-group-technique.md) and [Ranked Voting](ranked-voting.md) for team decisions

### Hybrid Team Decision-Making Strategies

*Effective decision-making in distributed/hybrid teams requires explicit attention to inclusion, timing, and communication methods.*

#### Synchronous Decision Approaches
**Real-time Collaborative Decisions:**
- **Facilitated video sessions**: Use structured facilitation with screen sharing for complex decisions requiring immediate discussion
- **Digital whiteboarding**: Employ collaborative tools for visual decision-making processes (pros/cons lists, impact/effort matrices)
- **Time-boxed discussions**: Set clear time limits for debate with explicit decision points to maintain momentum
- **Rotating facilitation**: Share facilitation across time zones to ensure equal participation opportunities

#### Asynchronous Decision Processes  
**Distributed Consultation and Feedback:**
- **Structured advice gathering**: Use forms or templates to collect consistent input from stakeholders across different time zones
- **Decision documents**: Create shared documents with clear decision proposals, rationale, and deadline for feedback
- **Threaded discussions**: Use discussion tools that maintain context and allow for thoughtful, non-immediate responses
- **Progressive disclosure**: Share decision context first, allow processing time, then collect recommendations

#### Inclusion and Participation
**Ensuring Equal Voice:**
- **Time zone rotation**: Rotate meeting times for important decisions to share the inconvenience burden
- **Multiple input channels**: Provide both synchronous and asynchronous ways to contribute to decisions
- **Cultural adaptation**: Acknowledge different communication styles and decision-making preferences across cultures
- **Follow-up protocols**: Always confirm understanding and buy-in after decisions, especially from remote participants

### Decision Documentation Templates

4. **Adapt for Hybrid Context**: Ensure remote team members have equal participation opportunities
5. **Seek Advice**: Consult with domain experts and affected stakeholders using structured approaches
6. **Document Important Decisions**: Use [Architecture Decision Records](architecture-decision-records.md) for significant choices
7. **Communicate Transparently**: Share decision rationale and invite feedback through multiple channels
