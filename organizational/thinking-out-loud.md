# Thinking Out Loud

## Summary
Create clarity, trust, and better decisions. Encourage team members to voice their reasoning, assumptions, and uncertainties in real-time before taking action.

## Context
Software development involves constant decision-making, often with incomplete information. Team members may make assumptions, see different aspects of problems, or have valuable insights. These insights often remain unexpressed until after decisions are made.

## Problem
Silent decision-making leads to misalignment, missed opportunities for input, and solutions that could have been improved with collaborative thinking. Teams also struggle with psychological safety when people hide uncertainty rather than acknowledge it.

## Solution
Set up "Thinking Out Loud" as a regular practice. Team members should share their reasoning, assumptions, and uncertainties before making decisions or taking action. This creates opportunities for collaboration, feedback, and early course correction.

## Forces
- Individual Efficiency vs. Collective Wisdom - Stopping to think aloud takes time but improves outcomes
- Confidence vs. Vulnerability - Sharing uncertainty requires psychological safety
- Speed vs. Alignment - Talking through ideas may slow immediate action but prevents later rework
- Expertise vs. Humility - Experienced team members may resist showing uncertainty

## Implementation
1. **Model the Behavior**: Leaders and senior team members demonstrate thinking out loud first
2. **Invite Participation**: Explicitly ask team members to share their thinking process
3. **Normalize Uncertainty**: Make it acceptable and expected to voice doubts and assumptions
4. **Integrate into Routines**: Build thinking out loud into daily operations, standups, and planning
5. **Listen Without Jumping In**: Use silence and curiosity rather than quick correction
6. **Use Open Channels**: Encourage public discussion in team channels rather than private messages

## Examples
**During Development:**
- "I'm about to refactor this module because I think the current structure is making it hard to test. Does anyone see issues with this approach?"
- "I'm uncertain about the error handling here - wondering if we should fail fast or try to recover..."

**In Planning:**
- "I'm thinking we should prioritize the API changes first, but I'm not sure about the dependencies with the frontend work..."
- "I wonder if we're missing something about the user workflow here..."

**When Seeking Help:**
- "We're working on the COS-exit feature - are there any REST APIs to fetch product offer texts? We need to retrieve texts by productOfferId and textType."
