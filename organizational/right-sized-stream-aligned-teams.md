# Right-Sized Stream-Aligned Teams

## Summary
Form small, mission-focused teams of 5-8 members that own a product value stream end-to-end, following the "you build it, you run it" principle.

## Context
Organizations need cross-functional teams that can deliver value independently while maintaining agility. There's tension between having diverse skills (requiring larger teams) and maintaining fast communication (favoring smaller teams).

## Problem
High-performing teams need diverse skills (business, development, operations, UX) to own a product end-to-end, but large teams suffer from communication overhead and reduced agility. Dependencies between teams slow delivery and dilute accountability.

## Solution
Create stream-aligned teams that are:

- **Right-sized**: 5-8 members (research shows 54% of practitioners prefer 6-7 as optimal)
- **Cross-functional**: Include all skills needed for end-to-end value delivery
- **Stream-aligned**: Focused on single, valuable stream of work
- **Autonomous**: Empowered to deliver and run their product slice
- **Cognitive load aware**: Respect team capacity limits and remove tasks when adding new ones

## Forces
- **Skill diversity vs. Team size**: Need multiple roles without communication explosion
- **Authority vs. Intimacy**: Balancing end-to-end ownership with team cohesion
- **Autonomy vs. Dependencies**: Minimizing hand-offs while serving business needs
- **Speed vs. Capability**: Fast decision-making versus comprehensive expertise

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Dense communication**: Everyone can talk with everyone else frequently
- **Fast flow**: Minimal waiting on other teams for value delivery
- **Clear accountability**: Unambiguous ownership of outcomes
- **High autonomy**: Teams can make decisions without external dependencies
- **Reduced coordination overhead**: Fewer inter-team dependencies to manage

### Negative
- **Skill constraints**: May lack deep expertise in all areas
- **Platform dependency**: Requires strong enabling infrastructure
- **Cognitive load risk**: Teams may become overwhelmed with too many responsibilities
- **Scaling challenges**: Need careful domain decomposition for multiple teams

## Examples
- **WhatsApp**: 13 engineers serving 500M users through small, focused teams
- **Amazon**: "Two pizza teams" owning specific service domains
- **Spotify**: Squads of 6-12 people owning specific features or services

## Implementation
1. Define clear value streams and product boundaries
2. Ensure each team has necessary skill mix within size constraints
3. Provide platform and enabling team support
4. Monitor and respect cognitive load limits
5. Use Team API pattern for clear external interfaces
