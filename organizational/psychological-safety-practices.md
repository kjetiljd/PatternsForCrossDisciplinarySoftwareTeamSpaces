# Psychological Safety Practices

## Summary
Create cultural norms and practices that enable team members to speak up, take risks, and admit mistakes without fear of negative consequences.

## Context
Team environments where innovation, learning, and high performance depend on open communication and shared problem-solving.

## Problem
Fear of judgment, blame, or negative consequences prevents people from contributing their best ideas, asking questions, or reporting problems.

## Solution
Implement practices that build psychological safety:
- **Blameless post-mortems**: Focus on learning from incidents rather than assigning blame
- **Leaders show vulnerability**: Managers and senior members admit mistakes first
- **Explicit team norms**: Written agreements about acceptable behavior and support
- **Safe space rituals**: Regular check-ins where people can share risks or concerns
- **Encourage questions**: Make it explicitly safe to ask for help or admit uncertainty
- **Diverse perspectives**: Actively seek and value different viewpoints

## Forces
- Innovation requires taking risks and potentially failing
- Learning requires admitting what you don't know
- High performance requires honest communication about problems
- Power dynamics can suppress honest feedback
- Trust takes time to build but can be quickly destroyed

## Examples
- Google's Project Aristotle identifying psychological safety as #1 factor
- Blameless culture at companies like Etsy and Netflix
- Retrospective practices that focus on systems over individuals
- XP's "courage" value encouraging difficult conversations
