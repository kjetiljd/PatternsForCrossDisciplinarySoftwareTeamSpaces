# Platform Teams & Communities of Practice

## Summary
Build service teams to handle shared systems. Create voluntary groups where people share knowledge across the company.

## Context
Many software teams need shared tools and common ways of working. They want to stay independent but also avoid waiting on other teams.

## Problem
Without shared systems, teams do the same work many times. Each team builds things differently. Without knowledge sharing groups, teams miss chances to learn from each other.

## Solution

### Platform Teams Structure

**Platform Team Mission**: Build and maintain shared services, tools, and systems. Help product teams work faster with less mental effort.

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Service-oriented**: Treat other teams as customers. Offer clear services
- **Self-service focus**: Let teams do routine tasks without waiting for help
- **Developer experience**: Make tools easy to use. Write excellent documentation
- **Business outcome alignment**: Platform capabilities directly support business goals
- **Full-stack ownership**: Own the entire lifecycle of their platforms

**Platform Team Types:**
1. **Infrastructure Platform Teams**: Handle cloud services, networking, security, and deployment
2. **Data Platform Teams**: Build data pipelines, analytics tools, ML systems, and data rules
3. **Developer Experience Teams**: Create CI/CD, testing frameworks, development tools, and code standards
4. **API Platform Teams**: Manage API gateways, service mesh, authentication, and monitoring

### Communities of Practice Structure

**Community Purpose**: Voluntary groups that advance shared knowledge and skills in specific areas.

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Voluntary participation**: Members join based on interest and passion
- **Knowledge sharing focus**: Main goal is learning and skill development
- **Cross-team membership**: Include people from multiple teams and disciplines
- **Practice evolution**: Keep improving methods, tools, and approaches
- **Mentorship culture**: Experienced people guide newcomers

**Common Community Types:**
1. **Technical Communities**: Frontend, backend, data science, security, testing
2. **Practice Communities**: Agile, design thinking, DevOps, architecture
3. **Domain Communities**: Customer experience, product management, business analysis
4. **Learning Communities**: New technology adoption, certification groups, book clubs

## Forces
- **Shared systems vs. team autonomy**: Platform services must help teams stay independent, not limit them
- **Standards vs. local needs**: Balance consistency with team-specific needs and innovation
- **Voluntary participation vs. company needs**: Communities must be voluntary while meeting business goals
- **Platform team capacity vs. consumer team demands**: Platform teams need sustainable workload and clear priorities
- **Service evolution vs. stability**: Keep improving without breaking existing integrations
- **Self-service vs. support overhead**: Reduce platform team work while keeping service quality high
