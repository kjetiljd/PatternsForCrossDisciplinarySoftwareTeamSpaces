# Platform Teams & Communities of Practice

## Summary
Create service teams for shared infrastructure and voluntary guilds for knowledge sharing across the organization.

## Context
Multiple software teams need shared infrastructure and common practices while maintaining autonomy and avoiding dependency bottlenecks.

## Problem
Without shared infrastructure, teams duplicate effort and create inconsistencies, while without knowledge sharing communities, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other.

## Solution
Establish platform teams that provide shared services and tools, complemented by voluntary communities of practice that facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development.

## Forces
- Shared infrastructure vs. team autonomy
- Standardization vs. local optimization
- Voluntary participation vs. organizational needs
- Platform team capacity vs. consumer team demands
