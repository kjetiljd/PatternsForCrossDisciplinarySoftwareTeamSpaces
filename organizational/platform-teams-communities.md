# Platform Teams & Communities of Practice

## Summary
Create service teams for shared infrastructure and voluntary guilds for knowledge sharing across the organization.

## Context
Multiple software teams need shared infrastructure and common practices while maintaining autonomy and avoiding dependency bottlenecks.

## Problem
Without shared infrastructure, teams duplicate effort and create inconsistencies, while without knowledge sharing communities, teams miss opportunities to learn from each other.

## Solution

### Platform Teams Structure

**Platform Team Mission**: Create and maintain shared services, tools, and infrastructure that enable product teams to move faster while reducing cognitive load.

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Service-oriented**: Treat other teams as customers with clear service offerings
- **Self-service focus**: Minimize dependency on platform team for routine operations
- **Developer experience**: Prioritize ease of use and excellent documentation
- **Business outcome alignment**: Platform capabilities directly support business objectives
- **Full-stack ownership**: Responsible for the entire lifecycle of their platforms

**Platform Team Types:**
1. **Infrastructure Platform Teams**: Cloud services, networking, security, deployment pipelines
2. **Data Platform Teams**: Data pipelines, analytics tools, ML infrastructure, data governance
3. **Developer Experience Teams**: CI/CD, testing frameworks, development tools, code standards
4. **API Platform Teams**: API gateways, service mesh, authentication, monitoring

### Communities of Practice Structure

**Community Purpose**: Voluntary groups focused on advancing collective knowledge and capability in specific domains.

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Voluntary participation**: Members join based on interest and passion
- **Knowledge sharing focus**: Primary goal is learning and skill development
- **Cross-team membership**: Include people from multiple teams and disciplines
- **Practice evolution**: Continuously improve methods, tools, and approaches
- **Mentorship culture**: Experienced practitioners guide newcomers

**Common Community Types:**
1. **Technical Communities**: Frontend, backend, data science, security, testing
2. **Practice Communities**: Agile, design thinking, DevOps, architecture
3. **Domain Communities**: Customer experience, product management, business analysis
4. **Learning Communities**: New technology adoption, certification groups, book clubs

## Forces
- **Shared infrastructure vs. team autonomy**: Platform services must enable rather than constrain team independence
- **Standardization vs. local optimization**: Balance consistency with team-specific needs and innovation
- **Voluntary participation vs. organizational needs**: Communities must be voluntary while addressing business objectives
- **Platform team capacity vs. consumer team demands**: Platform teams need sustainable workload and clear prioritization
- **Service evolution vs. stability**: Continuous improvement without breaking existing integrations
- **Self-service vs. support overhead**: Minimize platform team intervention while maintaining service quality
