# Cross-Team Synchronization

## Summary
Establish lightweight coordination routines like Scrum of Scrums and Open Space events to maintain alignment across multiple teams.

## Context
Multiple autonomous teams need to coordinate work, share information, and resolve dependencies without heavy coordination overhead.

## Problem
Without coordination mechanisms, teams can work at cross-purposes or miss opportunities for collaboration, while too much coordination can slow teams down.

## Solution
Implement lightweight coordination practices such as Scrum of Scrums, cross-team retrospectives, and Open Space events that maintain alignment without excessive overhead.

### Cadence Options

**Daily Synchronization (High-Frequency)**
- **When to Use**: Teams with tight dependencies or shared critical path
- **Format**: 5-10 minute daily pulse checks
- **Participants**: Team leads or designated coordinators
- **Agenda**: Blockers, dependencies, handoffs needed today

**Weekly Synchronization (Standard)**
- **When to Use**: Most cross-functional product teams
- **Format**: 30-45 minute structured sessions
- **Participants**: Team representatives + stakeholders as needed
- **Agenda**: Progress updates, upcoming dependencies, resource needs

**Bi-Weekly Synchronization (Low-Frequency)**
- **When to Use**: Loosely coupled teams or platform/enabling teams
- **Format**: 45-60 minute comprehensive sessions
- **Participants**: Broader stakeholder group
- **Agenda**: Strategic alignment, roadmap updates, architectural decisions

**Monthly Synchronization (Strategic)**
- **When to Use**: Independent teams with occasional collaboration
- **Format**: 60-90 minute strategic alignment sessions
- **Participants**: Leadership + team representatives
- **Agenda**: Quarterly planning, resource allocation, cross-team initiatives

### Structured Agenda Templates

**Standard Cross-Team Sync Agenda (30-45 minutes)**
```
1. Quick Round-Robin (10 min)
   - Each team: Last sprint accomplishments, next sprint priorities
   - Flag any blockers or dependencies

2. Dependency Resolution (15 min)
   - Review cross-team dependencies
   - Assign owners and timelines
   - Identify escalation needs

3. Information Sharing (10 min)
   - Architecture changes affecting multiple teams
   - Resource availability updates
   - Upcoming deadlines or events

4. Action Items & Next Steps (5 min)
   - Capture decisions and next steps
   - Confirm next meeting cadence
   - Schedule follow-up sessions if needed
```

**Escalation-Focused Agenda (15-20 minutes)**
```
1. Blocker Identification (5 min)
   - Each team reports current blockers
   - Categorize: technical, resource, decision, external

2. Rapid Resolution (10 min)
   - Address blockers that can be resolved immediately
   - Assign owners for complex blockers
   - Set timelines for resolution

3. Escalation Path (5 min)
   - Identify issues requiring leadership involvement
   - Schedule escalation meetings
   - Document decision needs
```

### Escalation Paths and Protocols

**Three-Tier Escalation Model**

**Tier 1: Team-Level Resolution**
- **Scope**: Technical dependencies, resource sharing, schedule coordination
- **Participants**: Team leads, architects, product owners
- **Timeline**: Resolved within 1-2 sync cycles
- **Documentation**: Captured in team coordination tools

**Tier 2: Program-Level Resolution**
- **Scope**: Resource conflicts, priority disputes, architectural decisions
- **Participants**: Program managers, engineering managers, senior architects
- **Timeline**: Resolved within 1 week
- **Documentation**: Formal decision records with rationale

**Tier 3: Leadership Resolution**
- **Scope**: Strategic conflicts, major resource reallocation, organizational changes
- **Participants**: VPs, directors, senior leadership
- **Timeline**: Escalated immediately, resolved within 2 weeks
- **Documentation**: ADRs with business impact analysis

**Escalation Triggers**
- Dependencies blocking critical path for >3 days
- Resource conflicts affecting multiple teams
- Technical decisions requiring architectural review
- Priority conflicts between team commitments
- Budget or timeline impacts >10% of quarterly goals

### Implementation Frameworks

**Lightweight Coordination Principles**
1. **Default to Async**: Use synchronous meetings only for complex discussions
2. **Time-Box Ruthlessly**: Respect everyone's time with strict time limits
3. **Document Decisions**: Capture outcomes for teams not present
4. **Rotate Facilitation**: Distribute coordination responsibility
5. **Measure Effectiveness**: Track resolution time and team satisfaction

**Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- **Status Theater**: Meetings focused on updates rather than coordination
- **Solution Shopping**: Bringing problems without attempting resolution
- **Scope Creep**: Expanding beyond coordination into team management
- **Information Hoarding**: Withholding context needed for decisions
- **Escalation Avoidance**: Delaying difficult conversations

## Forces
- Team autonomy vs. organizational alignment
- Coordination overhead vs. collaboration benefits
- Scheduled synchronization vs. organic coordination
- Formal processes vs. informal communication
- Synchronous collaboration vs. asynchronous coordination
- Centralized decision-making vs. distributed authority

## Implementation
**Getting Started**
1. Map current cross-team dependencies and pain points
2. Choose appropriate cadence based on coupling level
3. Establish clear escalation criteria and paths
4. Create shared documentation and decision-making tools
5. Start with weekly sync and adjust based on effectiveness

**Success Metrics**
- Average time to resolve cross-team blockers
- Number of escalations requiring leadership intervention
- Team satisfaction with coordination effectiveness
- Percentage of dependencies resolved within SLA
- Cross-team collaboration frequency and quality
