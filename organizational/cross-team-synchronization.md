# Cross-Team Synchronization

## Summary
Establish lightweight coordination routines like Scrum of Scrums and Open Space events to maintain alignment across multiple teams.

## Context
Multiple autonomous teams need to coordinate work, share information, and resolve dependencies without heavy coordination overhead.

## Problem
Without coordination mechanisms, teams can work at cross-purposes or miss opportunities for collaboration, while too much coordination can slow teams down.

## Solution
Implement lightweight coordination practices such as Scrum of Scrums, cross-team retrospectives, and Open Space events that maintain alignment without excessive overhead.

## Forces
- Team autonomy vs. organizational alignment
- Coordination overhead vs. collaboration benefits
- Scheduled synchronization vs. organic coordination
- Formal processes vs. informal communication
