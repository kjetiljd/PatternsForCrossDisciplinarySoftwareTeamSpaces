# One-Way vs Two-Way Door Decisions

## Summary
Accelerate decision-making by categorizing decisions based on reversibility - empowering teams to move fast on reversible decisions while applying rigorous processes to irreversible ones.

## Context
Software teams face constant decisions ranging from internal logic changes to public API modifications. The speed of decision-making directly impacts team velocity and market responsiveness, but inappropriate speed can lead to costly mistakes.

## Problem
Teams often apply the same decision-making weight to all choices, either creating bottlenecks by over-processing simple decisions or rushing through complex ones that require careful consideration. This leads to either paralysis or poor outcomes.

## Solution
Categorize decisions into two types:
- **Two-Way Door Decisions**: Reversible choices where the cost of undoing is low. Handle these with speed and team empowerment.
- **One-Way Door Decisions**: Irreversible or costly-to-reverse choices. Apply rigorous processes with stakeholder input and risk analysis.

Before making any decision, ask: "What kind of door is this?" and match the decision process to the reversibility.

## Forces
- Speed vs. Risk - Fast decisions enable agility but may increase risk
- Empowerment vs. Oversight - Teams want autonomy but need guidance on high-stakes choices
- Learning vs. Consequences - Experimentation requires safety to fail
- Resource Efficiency vs. Thoroughness - Time spent on decision-making must match decision importance

## Implementation

### Decision Classification Tools

**Primary Classification Framework:**

*The Reversibility Assessment Matrix:*

| Factor | Two-Way Door (Reversible) | Gray Zone | One-Way Door (Irreversible) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Financial Cost to Reverse** | <$10K or <1% of project budget | $10K-$100K or 1-10% of budget | >$100K or >10% of budget |
| **Time to Reverse** | <1 week | 1 week - 3 months | >3 months |
| **External Impact** | Internal team only | Partner/vendor coordination | Customer/market-facing changes |
| **Technical Coupling** | Isolated/modular changes | Some dependencies | Core system/architecture |
| **Skill Requirements** | Existing team skills | Some new learning required | Significant expertise needed |
| **Regulatory/Legal** | No compliance impact | Minor compliance review | Major legal/regulatory changes |

*Classification Process:*
1. **Evaluate each factor** on the 3-point scale above
2. **Count the scores** across all factors  
3. **Apply decision rules:**
   - All or mostly "Two-Way Door": Proceed with fast process
   - All or mostly "One-Way Door": Apply rigorous process
   - Mixed "Gray Zone": Use escalation criteria (see below)

**Rapid Classification Questions:**

*30-Second Assessment:*
- **The Undo Test:** "Could we completely reverse this decision in under 2 weeks with minimal cost?"
- **The Regret Test:** "If this goes wrong, would the consequences be acceptable learning experiences?"
- **The Isolation Test:** "Can we contain the impact to our immediate team/system?"
- **The Recovery Test:** "Do we have clear ways to recover if this doesn't work out?"

*If all answers are "Yes" → Two-Way Door. If any answer is "No" → Deeper analysis required.*

**Context-Specific Classification Guides:**

*Technology Decisions:*
- **Two-Way Door:** Internal tooling, development practices, testing frameworks with export capabilities
- **Gray Zone:** Database choices with migration paths, cloud providers with portability
- **One-Way Door:** Programming language for core systems, fundamental architecture patterns

*Product Decisions:*
- **Two-Way Door:** Feature flags, UI experiments, internal workflows
- **Gray Zone:** Pricing models, feature positioning, integration partnerships  
- **One-Way Door:** Public APIs, brand identity, core value propositions

*Organizational Decisions:*
- **Two-Way Door:** Team structures, meeting formats, communication tools
- **Gray Zone:** Hiring practices, compensation bands, office locations
- **One-Way Door:** Company values, legal structure, major cultural changes

*Process Decisions:*
- **Two-Way Door:** Workflow tools, documentation formats, review processes
- **Gray Zone:** Release cycles, quality standards, compliance frameworks
- **One-Way Door:** Development methodologies, governance structures, audit requirements

### Escalation Criteria

**When Two-Way Door Decisions Become One-Way:**

*Threshold Triggers for Escalation:*
- **Scale Amplification:** Decision affects >50 people or >$500K in impact
- **Precedent Setting:** Decision creates expectations for similar future choices
- **External Visibility:** Decision becomes visible to customers, regulators, or media
- **Irreversible Side Effects:** Decision creates dependencies that can't easily be undone
- **Resource Commitment:** Decision requires dedicated staffing or infrastructure investment

*Escalation Process:*
1. **Immediate Pause:** Stop execution and gather decision stakeholders
2. **Reclassification:** Re-evaluate using full assessment matrix with expanded scope
3. **Stakeholder Expansion:** Include affected parties not originally consulted
4. **Risk Analysis:** Conduct formal risk assessment with mitigation strategies
5. **Decision Authority:** Escalate to appropriate decision-making level

**Gray Zone Decision Protocol:**

*When Classification Is Unclear:*
- **Time-Box Investigation:** Spend maximum 2-4 hours researching reversibility factors
- **Seek Precedents:** Look for similar decisions made previously and their outcomes
- **Consult Experts:** Get input from technical leads, legal, or business stakeholders
- **Default to Caution:** When in doubt, treat as One-Way Door until proven otherwise
- **Document Uncertainty:** Record what makes the decision difficult to classify

*Rapid Gray Zone Resolution:*
- **Pilot/Experiment First:** Can we test a smaller version to learn about reversibility?
- **Partial Implementation:** Can we implement incrementally to maintain reversibility?
- **Sunset Clauses:** Can we build in automatic expiration to force reevaluation?
- **Monitoring Triggers:** What early warning signs would indicate we need to reverse?

**Decision Quality Improvement:**

*Common Decision Traps and Cognitive Biases:*

- **Optimism Bias:** Underestimating reversal costs and overestimating success probability
- **Analysis Paralysis:** Treating two-way doors like one-way doors (perfectionism bias)
- **Rush to Judgment:** Treating one-way doors like two-way doors (overconfidence bias)
- **Stakeholder Blindness:** Missing affected parties in the decision process
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing with poor one-way door decisions because of previous investment
- **Availability Heuristic:** Overweighting recent examples when classifying decision reversibility
- **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking information that supports preferred classification rather than objective assessment

- **Planning Fallacy:** Systematically underestimating time and cost required for reversal

*Quality Checkpoints:*
- **Devil's Advocate Review:** Formally assign someone to argue against the decision
