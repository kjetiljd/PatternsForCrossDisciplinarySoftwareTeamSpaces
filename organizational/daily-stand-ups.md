# Daily Stand-Ups

## Summary
Short daily meetings to share progress and surface impediments quickly, maintaining team alignment and identifying collaboration opportunities.

## Context
Software teams need regular synchronization to coordinate work, share knowledge, and identify impediments without excessive meeting overhead.

## Problem
Without regular coordination, team members can work in isolation, duplicate efforts, or miss opportunities to help each other, while too many meetings can interrupt flow.

## Solution
Hold brief daily stand-up meetings where team members share what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any impediments they're facing.

## Forces
- Coordination needs vs. meeting overhead
- Information sharing vs. individual focus time
- Team alignment vs. autonomous work
- Hybrid team participation vs. in-person spontaneity
