# Daily Stand-Ups

## Summary
Short daily meetings to share progress and surface impediments quickly, maintaining team alignment and identifying collaboration opportunities.

## Context
Software teams need regular synchronization to coordinate work, share knowledge, and identify impediments without excessive meeting overhead.

## Problem
Without regular coordination, team members can work in isolation, duplicate efforts, or miss opportunities to help each other, while too many meetings can interrupt flow.

## Solution
Implement daily stand-ups adapted to your team's context, size, and working arrangements:

### Core Principles
- **Brevity**: 15 minutes maximum for teams up to 9 people
- **Focus**: Progress, plans, and impediments - not detailed problem-solving
- **Participation**: Everyone speaks, everyone listens
- **Action-oriented**: Identify collaboration opportunities and impediment removal
- **Consistent timing**: Same time daily to build routine

### Format Variations by Team Size and Context

#### Standard Format (3-7 team members)
**Structure**: Traditional "Three Questions"
- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What impediments do I face?

**Timing**: 2-3 minutes per person, 15 minutes total
**Best for**: Established co-located or hybrid teams with clear sprint goals

#### Large Team Format (8-12 team members)
**Structure**: "Walk the Board" approach
- Review work items on team board (in progress, done, blocked)
- People speak when their work is discussed
- Focus on exceptions and blockers, not routine updates

**Timing**: 1-2 minutes per work item, 15-20 minutes total
**Best for**: Larger teams working on shared objectives

#### Micro-Team Format (2-3 team members)
**Structure**: Informal "Coffee Check-in"
- Brief context sharing while reviewing shared task board
- Immediate coordination of work for the day
- Quick identification of pair programming opportunities

**Timing**: 5-10 minutes total
**Best for**: Small, tightly-knit teams with frequent natural interaction

#### Distributed Team Format (All remote or highly distributed)
**Structure**: "Async + Sync Hybrid"
- Daily async updates in team chat channel
- 2-3 times weekly brief video synchronization for complex coordination
- Standing agenda shared in advance

**Timing**: 2 minutes async daily, 10 minutes sync when scheduled
**Best for**: Teams across multiple time zones or with high async work preference

#### Multi-Team Format (Multiple interdependent teams)
**Structure**: "Scaled Stand-up"
- Each team does internal stand-up (10 minutes)
- Representative from each team joins cross-team stand-up (15 minutes)
- Focus on dependencies and integration points

**Timing**: 25 minutes total (parallel + serial)
**Best for**: Programs with multiple teams working on integrated deliverables

### Remote Facilitation Techniques

#### Technology Setup
- **Video mandatory**: Ensures engagement and non-verbal communication
- **Shared screen**: Display team board, burndown charts, or agenda
- **Rotation of facilitation**: Different person leads each day
- **Recording optional**: For team members who miss the meeting

#### Engagement Strategies
- **Camera-on norm**: Establish expectation for video participation
- **Speaking order rotation**: Prevent same people always going first/last
- **Virtual background consistency**: Optional team identity building
- **Mute between speaking**: Reduce audio distractions
- **Chat for parking lot**: Capture detailed discussions for after the meeting

#### Hybrid Team Adaptations
- **Room microphone**: Ensure remote participants can hear in-person conversations
- **Shared visual**: Display remote participants prominently for in-person team
- **Equal participation**: Remote people speak first to avoid being afterthoughts
- **Audio check**: Confirm remote participants can hear before starting
- **Double facilitation**: In-person facilitator + remote co-facilitator

#### Time Zone Management
- **Core hours overlap**: Schedule during maximum team overlap
- **Rotation scheduling**: Occasionally adjust timing to accommodate different team members
- **Async alternative**: Provide alternative for team members who genuinely cannot attend
- **Meeting notes**: Always share brief notes for people who missed

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Status Report Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: Stand-up becomes detailed progress report to manager
**Solution**: Focus on team coordination, not upward reporting

#### Problem-Solving Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: Team tries to solve complex problems during stand-up
**Solution**: Use "parking lot" to capture items for separate discussion

#### One-Person Show Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: One team member dominates the conversation
**Solution**: Structured turn-taking and time-boxing

#### Attendance Theater Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: People attend but don't truly participate or listen
**Solution**: Active facilitation and rotating speaking order

### Outcome Metrics and Effectiveness Measurement

#### Participation Metrics
- **Attendance rate**: Aim for 90%+ consistent attendance
- **Speaking participation**: All team members contribute equally
- **Engagement indicators**: Eye contact, questions asked, follow-up actions taken

#### Coordination Effectiveness
- **Collaboration discovery**: Number of working sessions scheduled as result of stand-up
- **Impediment resolution time**: How quickly blockers get addressed
- **Duplicate work prevention**: Instances where stand-up prevents redundant effort
- **Knowledge sharing**: Transfer of information that helps team members

#### Process Health Indicators
- **Meeting duration**: Consistently under 15 minutes for teams under 8 people
- **Action follow-through**: Percentage of commitments made that are kept
- **Team satisfaction**: Quarterly survey on stand-up value and effectiveness
- **Information freshness**: How often updates contain genuinely new information

#### Leading Indicators of Problems
- **Consistently long meetings**: May indicate poor facilitation or team size issues
- **Low participation**: May indicate psychological safety or engagement problems
- **Repetitive updates**: May indicate lack of progress or unclear goals
- **Frequent off-topic discussions**: May indicate need for additional coordination time

#### Measurement Techniques

**Weekly Quick Pulse** (2 minutes at end of week)
- "How valuable were our stand-ups this week?" (1-5 scale)
- "What would make them more effective?"

**Monthly Retrospective Data**
- Average meeting length over past month
- Count of collaboration sessions initiated through stand-ups
- Number of impediments raised vs. number resolved

**Quarterly Deep Dive**
- Anonymous survey on psychological safety in stand-ups
- Analysis of information flow patterns
- Assessment of coordination effectiveness vs. other mechanisms

### Customization Guidelines

#### For New Teams
- Start with standard format
- Focus on building routine and psychological safety
- Gradually optimize based on team needs

#### For Mature Teams
- Experiment with format variations
- Reduce structure as team coordination improves
- Consider transitioning to less frequent or async approaches

#### For Crisis Situations
- Increase frequency temporarily (twice daily)
- Add focus on risk mitigation and rapid response
- Include clear escalation paths for critical issues

#### For Innovation Work
- Emphasize experiment results and learning
- Include "what did we discover?" as fourth question
- Allow for more uncertainty in daily plans

## Forces
- Coordination needs vs. meeting overhead
- Information sharing vs. individual focus time
- Team alignment vs. autonomous work
