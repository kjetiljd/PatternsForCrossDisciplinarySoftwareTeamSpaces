# Daily Stand-Ups

## Summary
Short daily meetings to share progress and surface impediments quickly, maintaining team alignment and identifying collaboration opportunities.

## Context
Software teams need regular synchronization to coordinate work, share knowledge, and identify impediments without excessive meeting overhead.

## Problem
Without regular coordination, team members can work in isolation, duplicate efforts, or miss opportunities to help each other, while too many meetings can interrupt flow.

## Solution
Implement daily stand-ups adapted to your team's context, size, and working arrangements:

### Core Principles
- **Brevity**: 15 minutes maximum for teams up to 9 people
- **Focus**: Progress, plans, and impediments - not detailed problem-solving
- **Participation**: Everyone speaks, everyone listens
- **Action-oriented**: Identify collaboration opportunities and impediment removal
- **Consistent timing**: Same time daily to build routine

### Format Variations by Team Size and Context

#### Standard Format (3-7 team members)
**Structure**: Traditional "Three Questions"
- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What impediments do I face?

**Timing**: 2-3 minutes per person, 15 minutes total
**Best for**: Established co-located or hybrid teams with clear sprint goals

#### Large Team Format (8-12 team members)
**Structure**: "Walk the Board" approach
- Review work items on team board (in progress, done, blocked)
- People speak when their work is discussed
- Focus on exceptions and blockers, not routine updates

**Timing**: 1-2 minutes per work item, 15-20 minutes total
**Best for**: Larger teams working on shared objectives

#### Micro-Team Format (2-3 team members)
**Structure**: Informal "Coffee Check-in"
- Brief context sharing while reviewing shared task board
- Immediate coordination of work for the day
- Quick identification of pair programming opportunities

**Timing**: 5-10 minutes total
**Best for**: Small, tightly-knit teams with frequent natural interaction

#### Distributed Team Format (All remote or highly distributed)
**Structure**: "Async + Sync Hybrid"
- Daily async updates in team chat channel
- 2-3 times weekly brief video synchronization for complex coordination
- Standing agenda shared in advance

**Timing**: 2 minutes async daily, 10 minutes sync when scheduled
**Best for**: Teams across multiple time zones or with high async work preference

#### Multi-Team Format (Multiple interdependent teams)
**Structure**: "Scaled Stand-up"
- Each team does internal stand-up (10 minutes)
- Representative from each team joins cross-team stand-up (15 minutes)
- Focus on dependencies and integration points

**Timing**: 25 minutes total (parallel + serial)
**Best for**: Programs with multiple teams working on integrated deliverables

### Remote Facilitation Techniques

#### Technology Setup
- **Video mandatory**: Ensures engagement and non-verbal communication
- **Shared screen**: Display team board, burndown charts, or agenda
- **Rotation of facilitation**: Different person leads each day
- **Recording optional**: For team members who miss the meeting

#### Engagement Strategies
- **Camera-on norm**: Establish expectation for video participation
- **Speaking order rotation**: Prevent same people always going first/last
- **Virtual background consistency**: Optional team identity building
- **Mute between speaking**: Reduce audio distractions
- **Chat for parking lot**: Capture detailed discussions for after the meeting

#### Hybrid Team Adaptations
- **Room microphone**: Ensure remote participants can hear in-person conversations
- **Shared visual**: Display remote participants prominently for in-person team
- **Equal participation**: Remote people speak first to avoid being afterthoughts
- **Audio check**: Confirm remote participants can hear before starting
- **Double facilitation**: In-person facilitator + remote co-facilitator

#### Time Zone Management
- **Core hours overlap**: Schedule during maximum team overlap
- **Rotation scheduling**: Occasionally adjust timing to accommodate different team members
- **Async alternative**: Provide alternative for team members who genuinely cannot attend
- **Meeting notes**: Always share brief notes for people who missed

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Status Report Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: Stand-up becomes detailed progress report to manager
**Solution**: Focus on team coordination, not upward reporting

#### Problem-Solving Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: Team tries to solve complex problems during stand-up
**Solution**: Use "parking lot" to capture items for separate discussion

#### One-Person Show Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: One team member dominates the conversation
**Solution**: Structured turn-taking and time-boxing

#### Attendance Theater Anti-Pattern
**Problem**: People attend but don't truly participate or listen
**Solution**: Active facilitation and rotating speaking order

### Outcome Metrics and Effectiveness Measurement

#### Participation Metrics
- **Attendance rate**: Aim for 90%+ consistent attendance
- **Speaking participation**: All team members contribute equally
- **Engagement indicators**: Eye contact, questions asked, follow-up actions taken

#### Coordination Effectiveness
- **Collaboration discovery**: Number of working sessions scheduled as result of stand-up
- **Impediment resolution time**: How quickly blockers get addressed
- **Duplicate work prevention**: Instances where stand-up prevents redundant effort
- **Knowledge sharing**: Transfer of information that helps team members

#### Process Health Indicators
- **Meeting duration**: Consistently under 15 minutes for teams under 8 people
- **Action follow-through**: Percentage of commitments made that are kept
- **Team satisfaction**: Quarterly survey on stand-up value and effectiveness
- **Information freshness**: How often updates contain genuinely new information

#### Leading Indicators of Problems
- **Consistently long meetings**: May indicate poor facilitation or team size issues
- **Low participation**: May indicate psychological safety or engagement problems
- **Repetitive updates**: May indicate lack of progress or unclear goals
- **Frequent off-topic discussions**: May indicate need for additional coordination time

#### Measurement Techniques

**Weekly Quick Pulse** (2 minutes at end of week)
- "How valuable were our stand-ups this week?" (1-5 scale)
- "What would make them more effective?"

**Monthly Retrospective Data**
- Average meeting length over past month
- Count of collaboration sessions initiated through stand-ups
- Number of impediments raised vs. number resolved

**Quarterly Deep Dive**
- Anonymous survey on psychological safety in stand-ups
- Analysis of information flow patterns
- Assessment of coordination effectiveness vs. other mechanisms

### Transition Guidance Between Formats

#### From Standard to Large Team Format
**Trigger**: Team grows beyond 7 people or meetings consistently run over 15 minutes
**Transition**: Spend one week explaining "walk the board" approach, then switch
**Success indicator**: Meeting time stays under 20 minutes with larger team

#### From Standard to Distributed Format  
**Trigger**: Team becomes permanently distributed or time zone conflicts increase
**Transition**: Start with hybrid async/sync for 2 weeks, then evaluate frequency
**Success indicator**: Same level of coordination with reduced meeting burden

#### From Any Format to Crisis Mode
**Trigger**: Major incident, tight deadline, or team stress
**Transition**: Announce temporary change and expected duration upfront
**Return criteria**: Define specific conditions for returning to normal cadence

### Measurement Prioritization Framework

**Start Here (Week 1)**: Basic attendance and duration tracking
**Add Next (Month 1)**: Team satisfaction quick pulse 
**Advanced (Quarter 1)**: Coordination effectiveness metrics
**Expert Level**: Full analytical framework with trend analysis

**Red Flags to Act On Immediately**:
- Attendance below 70% for two weeks
- Meetings consistently over 20 minutes
- Team satisfaction below 3/5 for two weeks

### Cultural and Accessibility Considerations

#### Video Participation Alternatives
- **Bandwidth constraints**: Audio-only with screen sharing for agenda
- **Privacy concerns**: Virtual backgrounds or audio-only days
- **Accessibility needs**: Closed captions, sign language interpretation
- **Cultural norms**: Respect for camera-off preferences in some contexts

#### Speaking Order Flexibility
- **Hierarchical cultures**: Senior members speak last to avoid influence
- **Egalitarian cultures**: Random or rotating order
- **Neurodivergent teams**: Predictable order to reduce anxiety
- **Mixed preferences**: Let team establish their own norm

### Failure Recovery Protocols

#### When Stand-ups Become Status Reports
1. **Reset week**: Explicitly focus only on coordination needs
2. **Role clarification**: Manager observes but doesn't direct
3. **Question evolution**: Change questions to emphasize team help

#### When Meetings Consistently Run Long
1. **Time-box enforcement**: Use visible timer, hard stop at 15 minutes
2. **Parking lot discipline**: Facilitator actively redirects detailed discussions
3. **Format evaluation**: Consider switching to "walk the board" format

#### When Participation Drops
1. **Individual check-ins**: Understand why people aren't attending/participating
2. **Value clarification**: Team discussion on whether stand-ups are helpful
3. **Experiment with alternatives**: Try different times, formats, or frequencies

#### When Team Loses Focus
1. **Back to basics**: Return to simplest format for two weeks
2. **Facilitation rotation**: Change who leads to bring fresh energy
3. **Purpose reminder**: Revisit why the team chose to have stand-ups

### Integration with Team Rhythms

#### Connection to Sprint Planning
- Stand-ups help identify when sprint scope needs adjustment
- Sprint goals provide context for daily priorities
- Use stand-up insights to improve next sprint planning

#### Connection to Retrospectives
- Stand-up effectiveness should be regular retrospective topic
- Daily coordination issues inform process improvement discussions
- Team satisfaction with stand-ups indicates overall health

#### Connection to Other Meetings
- Stand-ups can replace some ad hoc coordination meetings
- Identify when stand-up topics need deeper discussion time
- Use stand-ups to schedule pairing or collaboration sessions

### Customization Guidelines

#### For New Teams
- Start with standard format
- Focus on building routine and psychological safety
- Gradually optimize based on team needs
- Expect 4-6 weeks to establish effective rhythm

#### For Mature Teams
- Experiment with format variations
- Reduce structure as team coordination improves
- Consider transitioning to less frequent or async approaches
- Trust team to evolve their own effective approach

#### For Crisis Situations
- Increase frequency temporarily (twice daily)
- Add focus on risk mitigation and rapid response
- Include clear escalation paths for critical issues
- Set explicit end date for crisis mode

#### For Innovation Work
- Emphasize experiment results and learning
- Include "what did we discover?" as fourth question
- Allow for more uncertainty in daily plans
- Focus on unblocking creative work rather than task tracking
