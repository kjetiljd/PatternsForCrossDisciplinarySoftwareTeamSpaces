# Team-to-Team Contracts

## Summary
Define explicit interfaces and protocols for inter-team collaboration to reduce coordination overhead and clarify expectations.

## Context
Software teams need to collaborate with other teams but lack clear agreements about how to work together effectively.

## Problem
Without explicit agreements, teams waste time negotiating collaboration approaches repeatedly and may have misaligned expectations about responsibilities and interfaces.

## Solution
Create explicit contracts between teams that define service level agreements, communication protocols, and collaboration interfaces for common interaction patterns.

## Forces
- Flexibility vs. predictability
- Formal agreements vs. informal relationships
- Standardization vs. contextual adaptation
- Overhead of maintaining contracts vs. benefits of clarity
