# Blameless Post-Mortems

## Summary
Focus on learning from incidents and failures by examining systems and processes rather than assigning blame to individuals.

## Context
Teams that experience incidents, outages, bugs, or project failures and need to learn from these experiences to prevent future occurrences.

## Problem
Traditional post-incident reviews often focus on finding someone to blame, which creates fear, reduces transparency, and prevents teams from learning the real systemic causes of problems.

## Solution
Implement blameless post-mortem practices:
- **Timeline focus**: Create detailed timelines of what happened, when, and what information was available
- **Systems thinking**: Examine processes, tools, communication patterns, and environmental factors
- **No blame language**: Avoid "human error" explanations and focus on why the system allowed the error
- **Learning outcomes**: Identify specific actions to improve systems, not punish individuals
- **Psychological safety**: Create safe space for people to share what they knew and when
- **Root cause analysis**: Dig deep into multiple contributing factors rather than stopping at first cause

## Forces
- People need to feel safe to share honest information about what went wrong
- Learning requires understanding all contributing factors, not just obvious ones
- Blame creates fear and reduces information sharing
- Systems and processes are usually more influential than individual actions
- Prevention requires changing systems, not just telling people to be more careful

## Examples
- Netflix's culture of "keeper of the flame" vs blame
- Etsy's famous blameless post-mortem practices
- Aviation industry's focus on systemic factors in accident investigation
