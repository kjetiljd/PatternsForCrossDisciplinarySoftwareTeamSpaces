# Embedded Coordination Roles

## Summary
Use ambassador or liaison roles to create human bridges between teams. This helps facilitate smooth inter-team coordination.

## Context
Teams need to coordinate with other teams. But they don't want to interrupt their work flow with constant coordination meetings and discussions.

## Problem
Without dedicated coordination roles, teams face problems. They either under-coordinate and miss important dependencies. Or they over-coordinate and create inefficiencies.

## Solution
Set up rotating ambassador roles where team members serve as liaisons to other teams. This helps coordination without requiring full team participation. Create clear role definitions, rotation schedules, and handover protocols. This ensures effective coordination continuity.

## Forces
- Coordination efficiency vs. full team involvement
- Role rotation vs. specialized coordination skills
- Time commitment vs. coordination quality
- Formal roles vs. organic coordination
- Individual development vs. team stability
- Context preservation vs. fresh perspectives

## Examples

**Technology Company**: 8 product teams use rotating quarterly ambassadors with senior developers as primary coordinators and junior developers shadowing, resulting in 40% reduction in coordination meetings.

**Financial Services**: 12 development teams across 3 business units employ business analyst ambassadors focused on requirements coordination, achieving earlier dependency identification and reduced project delays.

**Open Source Project**: 6 core teams use volunteer ambassador model with 3-month terms, improving alignment between teams and contributor experience.

### Role Descriptions and Responsibilities

**Primary Ambassador Role:**
- **Scope**: 15-20% of working time dedicated to coordination activities
- **Duration**: 2-4 sprint cycles (4-8 weeks typical)
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Attend cross-team synchronization meetings as team representative
  - Facilitate communication of dependencies, blockers, and deliverables
  - Maintain awareness of other teams' roadmaps and priorities
  - Serve as first point of contact for inter-team questions
  - Document and communicate coordination outcomes to home team
  - Identify and escalate coordination issues before they become blockers

**Secondary Ambassador Role:**
- **Scope**: 5-10% of working time, shadow the primary ambassador
- **Duration**: Same as primary, preparing for future rotation
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Attend coordination meetings as observer/backup
  - Maintain up-to-date understanding of coordination context
  - Provide coverage when primary ambassador is unavailable
  - Prepare for seamless transition to primary role

**Team Coordination Sponsor:**
- **Scope**: Senior team member or team lead
- **Duration**: Ongoing advisory role
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Provide guidance on coordination priorities and decisions
  - Ensure ambassadors have authority to make appropriate commitments
  - Resolve conflicts between coordination needs and team priorities
  - Support ambassador development and effectiveness

### Rotation Strategies

**Standard Rotation (Recommended):**
- **Duration**: 6-8 weeks per ambassador term
- **Overlap**: 1-2 weeks shadow period for handover
- **Frequency**: Rotate 2-3 times per year to balance continuity with fresh perspectives
- **Selection**: Volunteer-based with team lead guidance to ensure coverage

**Development-Focused Rotation:**
- Use ambassador roles as growth opportunities for mid-level team members
- Pair with senior mentor for guidance on complex coordination decisions
- Create clear progression path: Observer → Secondary → Primary → Mentor
- Document coordination lessons learned for organizational knowledge

### Handover Protocols

**Preparation Phase (1-2 weeks before transition):**
- Shadow current ambassador in all coordination activities
- Review coordination history, decisions, and ongoing issues
- Meet with key contacts from other teams
- Understand current dependencies and upcoming decisions

**Transition Documentation:**
- **Relationship Map**: Key contacts, their roles, and communication preferences
- **Active Coordination Items**: Current blockers, dependencies, and decisions in progress
- **Historical Context**: Previous decisions, their rationale, and outcomes
- **Escalation Paths**: When and how to escalate coordination issues
- **Team Commitments**: Outstanding promises and deliverables to other teams

**Handover Meeting Structure:**
1. **Context Transfer** (30 minutes): Review documentation with outgoing ambassador
2. **Stakeholder Introductions** (15 minutes): Meet key contacts from other teams
3. **Shadow Period** (1-2 coordination cycles): Observe before taking lead
4. **Responsibility Transfer** (checkpoint): Formal handoff of coordination authority
5. **Feedback Session** (1 week later): Assess handover effectiveness and adjust

**Knowledge Preservation:**
- Maintain shared coordination log accessible to all team members
- Document patterns and insights from coordination activities
- Create playbooks for common coordination scenarios
- Regular retrospectives on coordination effectiveness

### Role Boundaries and Authority

**Decision Authority:**
- **Can Commit**: Schedule dependencies, share roadmap updates, coordinate timing
- **Must Escalate**: Resource allocation, priority changes, architectural decisions
- **Emergency Protocol**: Contact team lead within 4 hours for urgent decisions
- **Documentation**: Record all commitments in shared team coordination log

**Communication Protocols:**
- Standard formats for coordination updates to home team
- Regular cadence for sharing coordination insights
- Clear channels for urgent coordination needs
- Balance between transparency and information overload

**Conflict Resolution:**
- **Step 1**: Direct discussion between ambassadors to understand root causes
- **Step 2**: Bring in coordination sponsors from both teams for mediation
- **Step 3**: Escalate to management if fundamental priorities conflict
- **Recovery**: Document lessons learned and adjust coordination approach

### Recognition and Career Impact

**Performance Recognition:**
- Include ambassador contributions in performance reviews
- Recognize coordination skills as leadership development
- Document cross-team relationship building achievements
- Value coordination impact in promotion discussions

**Time Allocation:**
- Ensure ambassador time is protected and valued, not seen as "extra work"
- Adjust individual contributor expectations during ambassador terms
- Credit coordination contributions toward team and individual goals

### Success Metrics

**Primary Indicators:**
- **Coordination Delays**: Reduction in project delays due to inter-team coordination issues
- **Emergency Meetings**: Decrease in urgent cross-team meetings (target: 50% reduction)
- **Issue Prevention**: Increase in proactive identification of coordination challenges

**Secondary Indicators:**
- Ambassador satisfaction with role experience and career development impact
- Team confidence in coordination capabilities
- Improved cross-team relationship quality as measured by collaboration feedback

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Coordination Bottleneck**: Ambassador becomes single point of failure
**Role Dumping**: Teams use ambassador to avoid coordination responsibilities
**Authority Confusion**: Unclear decision-making boundaries lead to conflicts
**Rotation Chaos**: Too frequent rotation prevents relationship building
**Information Hoarding**: Ambassadors don't share coordination insights with team
