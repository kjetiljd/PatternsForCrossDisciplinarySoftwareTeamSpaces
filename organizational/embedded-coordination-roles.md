# Embedded Coordination Roles

## Summary
Use ambassador or liaison roles to create human bridges between teams and facilitate smooth inter-team coordination.

## Context
Teams need to coordinate with other teams but don't want to interrupt their work flow with constant coordination meetings and discussions.

## Problem
Without dedicated coordination roles, teams either under-coordinate and miss important dependencies, or over-coordinate and create inefficiencies.

## Solution
Establish rotating ambassador roles where team members serve as liaisons to other teams, facilitating coordination without requiring full team participation.

## Forces
- Coordination efficiency vs. full team involvement
- Role rotation vs. specialized coordination skills
- Time commitment vs. coordination quality
- Formal roles vs. organic coordination
