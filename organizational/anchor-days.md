# Anchor Days

## Summary
Designate regular days where the whole team comes on-site together for purposeful connection, relationship-building, and collaborative work.

## Context
Hybrid work environments where teams are distributed but need regular in-person connection to maintain trust and collaboration.

## Problem
Rigid "3 days in office" mandates often result in people coming in just to sit on Zoom calls. Teams lose the benefits of in-person interaction without gaining focus time.

## Solution
Implement purposeful anchor days:
- **Regular rhythm**: Every first Tuesday of the month, or similar predictable schedule
- **Whole team**: Everyone commits to being present (not just whoever happens to be in)
- **Purpose-built**: Focus on activities that benefit from in-person interaction
- **Relationship-first**: Prioritize bonding, brainstorming, and social connection
- **Food and space**: Provide meals and comfortable gathering spaces
- **No regular meetings**: Avoid filling the day with routine work that could be done remotely

## Forces
- Remote work can erode team relationships and trust
- Spontaneous collaboration requires critical mass of people
- Hybrid schedules need coordination to be effective
- Teams need face-to-face time for complex problem-solving
- Forced office time without purpose feels punitive

## Examples
- Companies using monthly all-hands anchor days
- Project teams doing 4-month period planning sessions in person
- GitLab's annual in-person summits despite being fully remote
