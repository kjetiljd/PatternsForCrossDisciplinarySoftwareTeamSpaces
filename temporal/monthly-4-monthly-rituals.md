# Monthly/4-Month Period Rituals

## Summary
Innovation days, hackathons, and Open Space events for learning and improvement that break routine and encourage experimentation.

## Context
Teams need regular opportunities to step back from routine work, experiment with new ideas, and engage in learning and improvement activities.

## Problem
Without regular breaks from routine work, teams can become stagnant, miss innovation opportunities, and lose motivation for continuous improvement.

## Solution
Establish monthly or 4-month period rituals like innovation days, hackathons, and Open Space events that encourage experimentation and learning.

## Forces
- Routine productivity vs. innovation time
- Individual vs. collective learning
- Structured vs. organic experimentation
