# Rituals as Spatial Anchors

## Summary
Use consistent locations for regular activities. This creates meaningful links and strengthens the connection between space and practice.

## Context
Teams benefit from creating strong links between spaces and activities. This reinforces rituals and creates meaningful environments.

## Problem
Without spatial anchors, rituals feel disconnected from place. They lose their power to create meaningful boundaries and links.

## Solution
Always use specific locations for regular activities and rituals. This creates strong spatial links and reinforces the meaning of practices.

## Forces
- Consistency vs. flexibility in space usage
- Ritual reinforcement vs. space efficiency
- Meaningful links vs. practical constraints
- Physical vs. virtual space anchoring
