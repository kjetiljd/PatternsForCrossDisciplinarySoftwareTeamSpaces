# Rituals as Spatial Anchors

## Summary
Use consistent locations for recurring activities to create meaningful associations and strengthen the connection between space and practice.

## Context
Teams benefit from creating strong associations between spaces and activities to reinforce rituals and create meaningful environments.

## Problem
Without spatial anchors, rituals can feel disconnected from place and lose their power to create meaningful boundaries and associations.

## Solution
Consistently use specific locations for recurring activities and rituals to create strong spatial associations and reinforce the meaning of practices.

## Forces
- Consistency vs. flexibility in space usage
- Ritual reinforcement vs. space efficiency
- Meaningful associations vs. practical constraints
- Physical vs. virtual space anchoring
