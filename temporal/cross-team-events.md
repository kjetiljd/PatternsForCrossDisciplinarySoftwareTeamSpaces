# Cross-Team Events

## Summary
Regular demo days and science fairs that bring teams together in common spaces to share work and discover collaboration opportunities.

## Context
Multiple teams working in parallel need opportunities to share their work, learn from each other, and discover collaboration opportunities.

## Problem
Without regular cross-team events, teams can become isolated and miss opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration.

## Solution
Establish regular events like demo days, science fairs, and showcase events that bring teams together to share work and discover connections.

## Forces
- Team autonomy vs. cross-team learning
- Presentation overhead vs. sharing benefits
- Formal vs. informal sharing formats
- Time investment vs. collaboration opportunities
