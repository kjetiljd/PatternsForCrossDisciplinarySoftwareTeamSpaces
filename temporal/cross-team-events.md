# Cross-Team Events

## Summary
Regular demo days and science fairs bring teams together in common spaces. Teams share work and discover ways to collaborate.

## Context
Multiple teams work in parallel. They need chances to share their work, learn from each other, and discover ways to collaborate.

## Problem
Without regular cross-team events, teams become isolated. They miss chances to share knowledge and collaborate.

## Solution
Set up regular events like demo days, science fairs, and showcase events. These bring teams together to share work and discover connections.

## Forces
- Team autonomy vs. cross-team learning
- Presentation overhead vs. sharing benefits
- Formal vs. informal sharing formats
- Time spent vs. collaboration chances
