# No-Meeting Time

## Summary
Designated periods free from meetings to enable flow states and deep work for complex problem-solving.

## Context
Software development requires extended periods of concentration for complex problem-solving, but meetings can fragment attention and prevent deep work.

## Problem
Frequent meetings interrupt flow states and prevent the sustained concentration needed for complex software development tasks.

## Solution
Establish protected time periods where no meetings are scheduled, allowing team members to engage in deep work and enter flow states.

## Forces
- Deep work needs vs. collaboration requirements
- Individual focus vs. team coordination
- Scheduled protection vs. organic flow
- Meeting efficiency vs. time protection
