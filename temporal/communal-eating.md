# Communal Eating

## Summary
Shared meals bring people together as equals. They create spaces for informal talk and idea sharing. This builds relationships and helps collaboration.

## Context
Teams need chances for informal relationship building and idea sharing outside of formal work.

## Problem
Without informal interactions, teams stay focused only on tasks. They miss chances to build relationships and find unexpected collaboration.

## Solution
Create chances for shared meals and eating together. These meals bring people together as equals. They give spaces for informal talk and idea sharing.

## Forces
- Work focus vs. social connection
- Individual meal preferences vs. communal benefits
- Time spent vs. relationship building
- Including everyone vs. personal preferences
