# Communal Eating

## Summary
Shared meals as social equalizers and spaces for informal idea exchange that build relationships and foster collaboration.

## Context
Teams need opportunities for informal relationship building and idea exchange outside of formal work contexts.

## Problem
Without informal interaction opportunities, teams can remain task-focused and miss opportunities for relationship building and serendipitous collaboration.

## Solution
Create opportunities for shared meals and communal eating that serve as social equalizers and spaces for informal conversation and idea exchange.

## Forces
- Work focus vs. social connection
- Individual meal preferences vs. communal benefits
- Time investment vs. relationship building
- Inclusivity vs. participation preferences
