# Annual/Seasonal Patterns

## Summary
Use yearly offsites, 4-month planning periods, and regular cool-down times. These should match natural rhythms and how your organization works.

## Context
Teams and organizations need longer rhythms that match natural cycles. These rhythms give chances for strategic planning and building relationships.

## Problem
Without longer patterns, teams lose sight of big goals. They miss chances for deeper connections and planning.

## Solution
Set up yearly and seasonal patterns like annual offsites, 4-month strategic planning, and regular cool-down periods. These should match natural rhythms.

## Forces
- Long-term planning vs. agile responsiveness
- Strategic focus vs. tactical execution
- Seasonal changes vs. consistent productivity
- Investing in planning vs. immediate delivery
