# Annual/Seasonal Patterns

## Summary
Yearly offsites, quarterly planning, and cyclical cool-down periods that align with natural rhythms and organizational cycles.

## Context
Teams and organizations need longer-term rhythms that align with natural cycles and provide opportunities for strategic planning and relationship building.

## Problem
Without longer-term patterns, teams can lose sight of strategic goals and miss opportunities for deeper connection and planning.

## Solution
Establish annual and seasonal patterns such as yearly offsites, quarterly strategic planning, and cyclical cool-down periods that align with natural rhythms.

## Forces
- Long-term planning vs. agile responsiveness
- Strategic focus vs. tactical execution
- Seasonal variation vs. consistent productivity
- Investment in planning vs. immediate delivery
