# Weekly Cadence

## Summary
Regular planning on Mondays and demos/retrospectives on Fridays to create predictable rhythm and closure for work cycles.

## Context
Teams need predictable rhythms to plan work effectively and create closure for completed work while maintaining flexibility for responsive development.

## Problem
Without weekly structure, teams can lose momentum, miss planning opportunities, and fail to reflect on and improve their work practices.

## Solution
Establish weekly rhythms with planning activities early in the week and reflection/demo activities at the end to create natural work cycles.

## Forces
- Predictable rhythm vs. responsive flexibility
- Weekly planning vs. daily adaptation
- Team coordination vs. individual schedules
- Closure vs. continuous flow
