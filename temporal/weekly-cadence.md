# Weekly Cadence

## Summary
Regular planning on Mondays and demos/retrospectives on Fridays to create predictable rhythm and closure for work cycles.

## Context
Teams need predictable rhythms to plan work effectively and create closure for completed work while maintaining flexibility for responsive development.

## Problem
Without weekly structure, teams can lose momentum, miss planning opportunities, and fail to reflect on and improve their work practices.

## Solution
Establish weekly rhythms with planning activities early in the week and reflection/demo activities at the end to create natural work cycles.

### Alternative Cadence Models

**Standard Monday-Friday Cadence:**
- **Monday:** Planning and goal setting (1-2 hours)
- **Wednesday:** Mid-week check-in and adjustment (30 minutes)
- **Friday:** Demo and retrospective (1-2 hours)
- **Best for:** Traditional business teams with stable weekday schedules

**Tuesday-Thursday Cadence:**
- **Tuesday:** Planning session (accommodates Monday holidays/issues)
- **Thursday:** Demo and retrospective (allows Friday for implementation)
- **Best for:** Teams with frequent Monday conflicts or Friday early departures

**Compressed 4-Day Cadence:**
- **Monday:** Planning and kickoff
- **Thursday:** Demo, retrospective, and next week preview
- **Best for:** Teams working compressed schedules or when Fridays are less productive

**Rotating Weekly Cadence:**
- **Week 1:** Monday planning, Wednesday demo, Friday retrospective
- **Week 2:** Tuesday planning, Thursday demo, Friday retrospective
- **Best for:** Teams with varying schedules or international time zone challenges

**Bi-Weekly Sprint Cadence:**
- **Week 1 Monday:** Sprint planning and backlog refinement
- **Week 1 Friday:** Mid-sprint demo and adjustment
- **Week 2 Wednesday:** Sprint review and retrospective
- **Week 2 Friday:** Sprint closure and preparation
- **Best for:** Teams working on longer-term features or complex projects

**Global Team Cadence:**
- **Monday (Asia-Pacific):** Planning session with APAC team
- **Tuesday (Europe):** Planning session with European team
- **Wednesday (Americas):** Planning session with Americas team
- **Thursday (Global):** Cross-region demo and alignment
- **Friday (Regional):** Regional retrospectives and local closure
- **Best for:** Teams spanning multiple time zones with regional autonomy

### Facilitation Guidance

**Effective Planning Session Facilitation:**

*Pre-Session Preparation:*
- Review previous week's outcomes and metrics
- Prepare agenda with time allocations
- Gather relevant data and insights
- Ensure necessary stakeholders are available
- Set up visual collaboration tools

*Opening Techniques (5-10 minutes):*
- **Energy Check-in:** "How is everyone feeling about this week?"
- **Appreciation Round:** "What are you grateful for from last week?"
- **Focus Statement:** "What's our most important goal this week?"
- **Commitment Check:** "What are we committed to achieving?"

*Planning Activities (30-45 minutes):*
- **Silent Brainstorming:** Individual reflection before group discussion
- **Dot Voting:** Prioritize items democratically
- **Timeboxing:** Allocate specific time blocks for each topic
- **Dependency Mapping:** Visualize connections between tasks and teams
- **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies

*Closing Techniques (5-10 minutes):*
- **Goal Confirmation:** "Are we aligned on this week's priorities?"
- **Resource Check:** "Do we have what we need to succeed?"
- **Next Steps:** "Who is doing what by when?"
- **Energy Assessment:** "How confident are we about this week's plan?"

**Effective Demo/Retrospective Facilitation:**

*Demo Session Structure (30-45 minutes):*
- **Context Setting:** Brief overview of week's goals and focus
- **Feature Demonstration:** Live demos of completed work
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Structured feedback collection
- **Impact Discussion:** How does this work create value?
- **Next Steps:** What happens next with this work?

*Retrospective Techniques (30-45 minutes):*
- **Start/Stop/Continue:** What should we start, stop, or continue doing?
- **Glad/Sad/Mad:** Emotional reflection on the week's experiences
- **Sailboat Retrospective:** What helped us (wind) and what hindered us (anchors)?
- **Timeline Review:** Walk through the week chronologically
- **5 Whys Analysis:** Deep dive into specific issues or successes

*Facilitation Best Practices:*
- **Rotate Facilitation:** Each team member facilitates monthly
- **Use Visual Tools:** Whiteboards, sticky notes, digital collaboration platforms
- **Time Management:** Use visible timers and stick to agenda
- **Inclusive Participation:** Ensure all voices are heard
- **Action Orientation:** Focus on decisions and next steps
- **Psychological Safety:** Create space for honest feedback and vulnerability

### Transition Strategies

**From Ad-Hoc to Structured Weekly Rhythms:**

*Week 1-2: Assessment and Buy-in*
- Observe current team communication patterns
- Identify existing informal rhythms and successful practices
- Discuss the value of structured weekly rhythms with the team
- Address concerns and resistance to new meeting structures
- Gain commitment to experiment with weekly cadence for 30 days

*Week 3-4: Pilot Implementation*
- Start with simplified weekly structure (planning + retrospective only)
- Focus on building habits rather than perfecting processes
- Collect feedback after each session
- Adjust timing and format based on team input
- Celebrate small wins and improvements

*Week 5-8: Process Refinement*
- Add demo component once planning/retrospective rhythm is established
- Experiment with different facilitation techniques
- Include stakeholders gradually
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Train team members in facilitation skills

*Week 9-12: Full Implementation*
- Implement complete weekly cadence with all components
- Establish measurement and feedback systems
- Create accountability for continuous improvement
- Share learnings with other teams
- Plan for long-term sustainability

**From Other Cadences to Weekly Rhythms:**

*From Daily-Only Meetings:*
- Maintain daily stand-ups but add weekly planning and closure
- Use weekly sessions to address higher-level planning that daily meetings can't handle
- Position weekly meetings as strategic vs. daily tactical
- Show how weekly rhythms reduce need for ad-hoc planning meetings

*From Monthly/Quarterly Only:*
- Introduce weekly rhythms as "mini-versions" of existing longer cycles
- Use weekly sessions to ensure progress toward monthly/quarterly goals
- Demonstrate how weekly feedback loops prevent monthly surprises
- Maintain connection between weekly outcomes and longer-term objectives

*From Sprint-Based Cadences:*
- Align weekly rhythms with sprint boundaries where possible
- Use weekly sessions to supplement, not replace, sprint ceremonies
- Focus weekly sessions on team-internal coordination and improvement
- Maintain sprint planning, review, and retrospective for stakeholder engagement

**Common Transition Challenges and Solutions:**

*Challenge: "We already have too many meetings"*
- Solution: Audit existing meetings and replace/consolidate where possible
- Show how weekly rhythms reduce need for ad-hoc coordination meetings
- Start with shorter sessions and prove value before expanding

*Challenge: "Our work doesn't fit weekly cycles"*
- Solution: Focus on learning and communication cycles rather than delivery cycles
- Use weekly sessions for coordination even when work spans multiple weeks
- Adapt cadence to fit team's natural work patterns

*Challenge: "We can't get everyone together weekly"*
- Solution: Hybrid/asynchronous approaches with core group meeting and others participating virtually
- Rotate meeting times to accommodate different schedules
- Use asynchronous tools for input from those who can't attend

*Challenge: "We don't see the value"*
- Solution: Start with retrospectives only to build improvement culture
- Focus on solving real team problems through weekly rhythm
- Share success stories from other teams with similar challenges
