# Weekly Cadence

## Summary
Regular planning on Mondays and demos/retrospectives on Fridays to create predictable rhythm and closure for work cycles.

## Context
Teams need predictable rhythms to plan work effectively and create closure for completed work while maintaining flexibility for responsive development.

## Problem
Without weekly structure, teams can lose momentum, miss planning opportunities, and fail to reflect on and improve their work practices.

## Solution
Establish weekly rhythms with planning activities early in the week and reflection/demo activities at the end to create natural work cycles.

## Forces
- Predictable rhythm vs. responsive flexibility
- Weekly planning vs. daily adaptation
- Team coordination vs. individual schedules
- Closure vs. continuous flow

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Rhythm Design & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Team commitment to structured weekly rhythms
- [ ] Authority to establish team meeting schedules
- [ ] Understanding of team's current work patterns

**Weekly Structure Definition:**
- [ ] Choose consistent weekly meeting times (same day/time each week)
- [ ] Block Monday planning sessions (1-2 hours for most teams)
- [ ] Schedule Friday demo/retrospective sessions (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Reserve mid-week check-in slots if needed (optional)
- [ ] Align with organizational calendar constraints

**Planning Session Design (Mondays):**
- [ ] Define planning agenda template:
  - [ ] Review previous week outcomes and learnings
  - [ ] Discuss upcoming week priorities and commitments
  - [ ] Identify dependencies and risks
  - [ ] Assign work and establish goals
  - [ ] Plan collaboration and pairing activities
- [ ] Set up planning tools (boards, backlogs, shared documents)
- [ ] Establish time boundaries (target: 60-90 minutes maximum)

**Demo/Retrospective Design (Fridays):**
- [ ] Create demo session structure:
  - [ ] Showcase completed work to stakeholders
  - [ ] Share learnings and insights gained
  - [ ] Demonstrate progress toward goals
- [ ] Design retrospective format:
  - [ ] What went well this week?
  - [ ] What could be improved?
  - [ ] What will we try next week?
- [ ] Plan celebration and closure activities

### Phase 2: Process Implementation (Weeks 2-6)
**Planning Session Execution:**
- [ ] Start each Monday with energy and team alignment
- [ ] Use visual planning tools (boards, charts, shared screens)
- [ ] Ensure all team members participate actively
- [ ] Focus on outcomes and value, not just tasks
- [ ] Document decisions and commitments clearly

**Mid-Week Adjustments:**
- [ ] Allow for plan modifications based on new information
- [ ] Maintain flexibility while respecting weekly commitments
- [ ] Use daily stand-ups to track progress toward weekly goals
- [ ] Address blockers and dependencies as they arise

**Friday Closure Activities:**
- [ ] Demo work to internal stakeholders or customers
- [ ] Conduct honest retrospectives focused on learning
- [ ] Celebrate achievements and milestones
- [ ] Create clean closure before weekend break
- [ ] Document insights for next week's planning

### Phase 3: Rhythm Optimization (Weeks 4-8)
**Facilitation Excellence:**
- [ ] Rotate facilitation responsibilities within team
- [ ] Train team members in effective meeting facilitation
- [ ] Use timeboxing to keep sessions productive
- [ ] Employ techniques like silent brainstorming and dot voting
- [ ] Focus on decisions and actions, not just discussion

**Stakeholder Integration:**
- [ ] Invite customers or users to Friday demos when appropriate
- [ ] Include product owners and managers in planning as needed
- [ ] Share weekly outcomes with broader organization
- [ ] Create feedback loops from stakeholders back to team

**Continuous Improvement:**
- [ ] Regularly assess weekly rhythm effectiveness
- [ ] Adjust timing, format, or content based on team feedback
- [ ] Experiment with different facilitation techniques
- [ ] Integrate insights from retrospectives into process improvements

### Phase 4: Advanced Practices (Month 2+)
**Cross-Team Coordination:**
- [ ] Align weekly rhythms with other teams when beneficial
- [ ] Share demos and learnings across team boundaries
- [ ] Coordinate planning for dependencies and shared resources
- [ ] Participate in organizational rhythm and cadence

**Measurement & Metrics:**
- [ ] Track team velocity and throughput weekly
- [ ] Monitor stakeholder satisfaction with demo quality
- [ ] Assess team engagement and energy levels
- [ ] Measure improvement implementation from retrospectives

**Scaling & Adaptation:**
- [ ] Adapt rhythm for hybrid/remote team members
- [ ] Integrate with quarterly and annual planning cycles
- [ ] Support new team members in understanding rhythm
- [ ] Document and share successful practices with other teams

### Success Indicators
**Immediate (Weeks 2-4):**
- [ ] Consistent attendance at weekly rhythm sessions
- [ ] Clear weekly commitments and outcomes
- [ ] Visible team energy and engagement in sessions
- [ ] Stakeholders report valuable demos and updates

**Short-term (Weeks 4-8):**
- [ ] Team self-corrects and improves processes weekly
- [ ] Evidence of learning integration from retrospectives
- [ ] Increased predictability in team delivery
- [ ] Stakeholders actively participate in demos

**Medium-term (Weeks 8-16):**
- [ ] Weekly rhythm becomes natural and self-sustaining
- [ ] Team demonstrates consistent improvement over time
- [ ] External teams seek to learn from rhythm practices
- [ ] Clear evidence of increased team performance

### Measurements & Validation
**Process Metrics:**
- [ ] Weekly planning session duration (target: <90 minutes)
- [ ] Retrospective action item completion rate (target: >80%)
- [ ] Demo attendance and engagement levels
- [ ] Team satisfaction with weekly rhythm (target: >4/5)

**Outcome Metrics:**
- [ ] Consistent weekly goal achievement
- [ ] Stakeholder satisfaction with transparency and demos
- [ ] Team velocity and throughput trends
- [ ] Frequency of process improvements implemented

### Common Issues & Solutions
- [ ] **Meeting fatigue**: Shorten sessions, improve facilitation, focus on value
- [ ] **Low engagement**: Rotate responsibilities, vary formats, ensure psychological safety
- [ ] **Schedule conflicts**: Protect weekly rhythm time, negotiate organizational priorities
- [ ] **Lack of improvement**: Focus retrospectives on actionable items, track implementation
- [ ] **Stakeholder disengagement**: Improve demo quality, solicit feedback, show clear value
