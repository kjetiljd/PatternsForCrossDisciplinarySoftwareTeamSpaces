# Core Hours & Temporal Zoning

## Summary
Establish core collaboration hours when everyone is available for real-time interaction, and protect other times for deep work and flexibility.

## Context
Hybrid and flexible work environments where team members may have different schedules, time zones, or work preferences.

## Problem
Without coordination, teams struggle to find time for synchronous collaboration. Constant availability expectations prevent deep work and create stress.

## Solution
Implement temporal zoning:
- **Core hours**: Establish overlap period (e.g., 10am-2pm) when everyone is available
- **Protected time**: Designate hours for deep work (e.g., mornings before 10am)
- **No-meeting blocks**: Specific times when meetings are prohibited
- **Flexible boundaries**: Allow personal scheduling outside core hours
- **Maker vs. manager schedules**: Recognize different work patterns and batch meetings accordingly

## Forces
- Distributed teams need coordination for effective collaboration
- Deep work requires uninterrupted time blocks
- Different roles have different optimal work patterns
- Personal life needs vary across team members
- Time zone differences complicate scheduling

## Examples
- Microsoft's "Focus Friday" no-meeting policy
- Basecamp's "library rules" for quiet work
- Companies with "no meetings before 10am" policies
- GitLab's handbook-first approach reducing meeting needs
