# Core Hours & Temporal Zoning

## Summary
Establish core collaboration hours when everyone is available for real-time interaction, and protect other times for deep work and flexibility.

## Context
Hybrid and flexible work environments where team members may have different schedules, time zones, or work preferences.

## Problem
Without coordination, teams struggle to find time for synchronous collaboration. Constant availability expectations prevent deep work and create stress.

## Solution
Implement temporal zoning:
- **Core hours**: Establish overlap period (e.g., 10am-2pm) when everyone is available
- **Protected time**: Designate hours for deep work (e.g., mornings before 10am)
- **No-meeting blocks**: Specific times when meetings are prohibited
- **Flexible boundaries**: Allow personal scheduling outside core hours
- **Maker vs. manager schedules**: Recognize different work patterns and batch meetings accordingly

## Forces
- Distributed teams need coordination for effective collaboration
- Deep work requires uninterrupted time blocks
- Different roles have different optimal work patterns
- Personal life needs vary across team members
- Time zone differences complicate scheduling

## Global Team Considerations

### Multi-Zone Coordination Strategies

**Rotating Core Hours:**
- **Asia-Pacific Focus**: 9am-1pm AEST (5pm-9pm PST previous day, 1am-5am CET)
- **Europe-Americas Focus**: 2pm-6pm CET (8am-12pm EST, 5am-9am PST)
- **Americas-Pacific Focus**: 10am-2pm PST (1pm-5pm EST, 7pm-11pm CET)
- **Implementation**: Rotate focus every 2-3 months to share timezone burden

**Cascade Communication:**
- **Morning Handoff**: Asia-Pacific team shares updates for Europe team
- **Afternoon Handoff**: Europe team shares updates for Americas team
- **Evening Handoff**: Americas team shares updates for Asia-Pacific team
- **Documentation**: All handoffs recorded in shared systems for async review

**Zone-Specific Optimizations:**
- **Asia-Pacific**: Focus on detailed analysis and individual work
- **Europe**: Emphasize stakeholder meetings and planning sessions
- **Americas**: Prioritize implementation and rapid iteration
- **Cross-Zone**: Reserve for strategic decisions and critical problem-solving

### Hybrid Zone Management

**Split-Team Coordination:**
- **Local Core Hours**: 2-3 hours of overlap for co-located team members
- **Global Core Hours**: 1-2 hours of overlap for entire distributed team
- **Bridge Roles**: Designated team members who work across time zones
- **Async Buffers**: Built-in delays for cross-zone dependencies

**Temporal Equity:**
- **Shared Sacrifice**: Rotate inconvenient meeting times across team members
- **Zone Respect**: Avoid scheduling outside reasonable work hours
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect local holidays and work patterns
- **Flexibility Budget**: Allow schedule adjustments for life events

## Calendar Tool Integration

### Microsoft Outlook Integration

**Temporal Zone Setup:**
```
Core Hours: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (Daily)
