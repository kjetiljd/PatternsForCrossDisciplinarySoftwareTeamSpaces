# Daily Rituals

## Summary
Morning check-ins, walking meetings, and shutdown rituals to structure the day and create boundaries between work and personal time.

## Context
Software teams need structure to maintain focus and well-being while working in flexible environments that can blur boundaries between work and personal time.

## Problem
Without daily structure, team members can experience poor work-life boundaries, reduced focus, and missed opportunities for connection and coordination.

## Solution
Establish daily rituals that create structure, such as morning check-ins, walking meetings for certain discussions, and shutdown rituals to end the workday.

## Forces
- Structure vs. flexibility
- Individual preferences vs. team coordination
- Work-life boundaries vs. availability
- Ritual overhead vs. benefits of routine
