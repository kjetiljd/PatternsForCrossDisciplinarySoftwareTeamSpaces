# Daily Rituals

## Summary
Morning check-ins, walking meetings, and shutdown rituals structure the day. They create boundaries between work and personal time.

## Context
Software teams need structure to maintain focus and well-being. They work in flexible environments that can blur boundaries between work and personal time.

## Problem
Without daily structure, team members have poor work-life boundaries and reduced focus. They miss chances to connect and coordinate.

## Solution
Set up daily rituals that create structure. Examples include morning check-ins, walking meetings for certain talks, and shutdown rituals to end the workday.

## Forces
- Structure vs. flexibility
- Individual preferences vs. team needs
- Work-life boundaries vs. availability
- Ritual overhead vs. benefits of routine
