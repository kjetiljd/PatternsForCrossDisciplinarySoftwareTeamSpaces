# Team Health Checks

## Summary
Regular surveys and discussions about team well-being and collaboration to identify and address issues before they become problems.

## Context
Team dynamics and well-being can degrade over time without regular attention, affecting productivity and job satisfaction.

## Problem
Without regular health checks, teams may not notice declining dynamics, increasing stress, or collaboration issues until they become serious problems.

## Solution
Implement regular team health assessments through surveys, retrospectives, and discussions that identify issues early and create action plans for improvement.

## Forces
- Proactive vs. reactive problem-solving
- Individual vs. team health metrics
- Formal assessment vs. informal check-ins
- Privacy vs. transparency in health discussions
