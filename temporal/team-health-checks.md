# Team Health Checks

## Summary
Regular surveys and discussions about team well-being and collaboration to identify and address issues before they become problems.

## Context
Team dynamics and well-being can degrade over time without regular attention, affecting productivity and job satisfaction.

## Problem
Without regular health checks, teams may not notice declining dynamics, increasing stress, or collaboration issues until they become serious problems.

## Solution
Implement regular team health assessments through surveys, retrospectives, and discussions that identify issues early and create action plans for improvement.

#### Key Metrics Dashboard

**Health Trend Indicators**:
- Average scores for each health dimension over time
- Score variance (high variance may indicate team polarization)
- Response rate trends (low response rates may indicate disengagement)
- Comments sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral trends)

**Early Warning Signals**:
- Any dimension scoring below 2.5 for two consecutive periods
- Sudden drops in any score (>1 point decrease week-over-week)
- Response rate dropping below 70%
- Increase in negative comments or concerns

**Intervention Effectiveness**:
- Score improvements following intervention actions
- Time to recovery after identified problems
- Sustained improvements vs. temporary fixes
- Team member feedback on intervention effectiveness

#### Trend Analysis Techniques

**Monthly Trend Review**:
- Chart each health dimension over the past 6 months
- Identify correlation between scores and external events (deadlines, org changes, etc.)
- Compare team health trends to delivery metrics
- Look for seasonal or cyclical patterns

**Comparative Analysis**:
- Compare team health scores to organizational benchmarks
- Identify teams with consistently high health scores for learning
- Analyze correlation between team health and business outcomes
- Track relative improvement rates across different intervention types

**Predictive Indicators**:
- Identify leading indicators that predict future health issues
- Develop early warning thresholds for intervention
- Analyze which factors most strongly predict team success
- Create health forecasting models for proactive management

### Health Check Integration Practices
