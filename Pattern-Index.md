- **[Display of Work](cross-disciplinary/display-of-work.md)** - Leave prototypes and work-in-progress visible to invite curiosity and cross-pollination
- **[Toolbelt Availability](cross-disciplinary/toolbelt-availability.md)** - Provide shared gadgets and tools that any team can experiment with

### Architectural Studio Patterns

- **[Pin-Up Space](cross-disciplinary/pin-up-space.md)** - Dedicate walls for displaying design work and making the creative process visible
