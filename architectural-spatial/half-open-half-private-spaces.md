# Half-Open, Half-Private Spaces

## Summary
Create work alcoves that are 60-75% enclosed to balance privacy with connection. Use research-backed height specs and acoustic materials that enable focused work while keeping team awareness.

## Context
Software developers need spaces that give them privacy to concentrate while staying connected to their team and aware of ongoing activities. Modern hybrid teams need workspaces that support individual deep work and spontaneous collaboration. Teams shouldn't have to choose between isolation and distraction.

## Problem
Completely open spaces are too distracting for focused work. Fully enclosed spaces isolate team members and reduce spontaneous collaboration and osmotic communication. Most workspace designs fail to achieve the right balance, causing productivity loss from distractions or team dysfunction from over-isolation.

## Solution
Design work areas with precisely calculated partial enclosure. Use 60-75% visual barriers with heights between 1.2-1.4m for visual privacy while maintaining team connection. Include acoustic treatment appropriate for the activity type. Position barriers to create psychological territory while preserving accessibility and air circulation.

## Forces
- Focus and concentration needs vs. team communication
- Personal privacy vs. team awareness  
- Acoustic isolation vs. ability to overhear relevant conversations
- Individual preferences vs. team cohesion
- Cost efficiency vs. spatial flexibility
- Maintenance needs vs. material performance

## Further details

### Optimal Enclosure Dimensions
- **Visual Privacy Height**: 1.2-1.4m (48-55 inches) - blocks visual distractions while seated, allows standing interaction
- **Acoustic Barrier Height**: 1.6-1.8m (63-71 inches) for areas requiring speech privacy
- **Entry Opening Width**: 1.2-1.5m (48-60 inches) - wide enough to signal accessibility, narrow enough to define territory
