# Half-Open, Half-Private Spaces

## Summary
Create alcoves with 50-75% enclosure that balance privacy with connection, allowing for focused work while maintaining team awareness.

## Context
Software developers need spaces that provide enough privacy for concentration while maintaining connection to their team and awareness of ongoing activities.

## Problem
Completely open spaces are too distracting for focused work, while fully enclosed spaces isolate team members and reduce spontaneous collaboration and osmotic communication.

## Solution
Design work areas with partial enclosure - high enough to provide visual privacy while seated, but low enough to maintain awareness of team activities and enable easy communication.

## Forces
- Focus and concentration needs vs. team communication
- Personal privacy vs. team awareness
- Acoustic isolation vs. ability to overhear relevant conversations
- Individual preferences vs. team cohesion
