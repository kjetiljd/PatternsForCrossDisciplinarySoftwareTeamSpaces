# Small Team Rooms

## Summary
Limit each work room or open bay to about a dozen people or fewer to enable better team cohesion and reduce noise and anonymity.

## Context
Team workspace design that balances collaboration needs with focus requirements and human-scale social interaction.

## Problem
Large open offices create noise, distraction, and anonymity. People lose sense of team identity and struggle to concentrate or communicate effectively.

## Solution
Create small team rooms that:
- **Size limit**: Maximum 12 people, ideally 5-10 for optimal team dynamics
- **Partial enclosure**: Walls or barriers that define the space but allow connection
- **Shared resources**: Team whiteboard, meeting corner, shared storage
- **Acoustic comfort**: Sound absorption to manage noise levels
- **Team identity**: Space that the team can personalize and control
- **Adjacent quiet**: Access to phone booths or quiet areas for private work

## Forces
- Small groups develop stronger cohesion and trust
- Communication overhead grows non-linearly with team size
- People need territorial comfort and belonging
- Teams need identity and shared artifacts
- Concentration requires freedom from excessive noise
- Collaboration requires easy communication

## Examples
- Wells (1960s) studies showing preference for smaller office groupings
- Basecamp's quiet team areas with "library rules"
- Agile team rooms in software companies
- Alexander's research on optimal work group sizes
