# Adjacent Semi-Private Spaces

## Summary
Create small, semi-enclosed collaboration areas immediately adjacent to team work zones that enable quick transitions between individual work and team discussions without leaving the work context.

## Context
Software teams need frequent, informal collaboration that builds on shared work context. Traditional meeting rooms create barriers and interrupt work flow, while completely open spaces lack privacy for focused team discussions.

## Problem
Teams need a space for focused discussions that:
- Provides enough privacy for team conversations without complete isolation
- Maintains connection to the team's work context and artifacts
- Allows team members to quickly join or leave the discussion
- Doesn't require scheduling or booking procedures
- Supports both planned and spontaneous collaboration

## Solution
Design small collaboration alcoves immediately adjacent to team work areas:

**Physical Design:**
- 4-6 person capacity for small team discussions (15-25 m² / 160-270 sq ft)
- 50-75% visual enclosure using low walls (1.2-1.6m height), movable panels, or book shelves
- Open entrance facing the team work area - no doors to create barriers
- Sight lines to team work space to maintain context and awareness
- Acoustic treatment to contain conversations without complete sound isolation

### Detailed Acoustic Performance Specifications

#### Target Acoustic Metrics
- **Speech Privacy**: STI (Speech Transmission Index) 0.20-0.35 between adjacent spaces and team work area
- **Sound Reduction**: 10-15 dB attenuation for speech frequencies (125-4000 Hz)
- **Reverberation Time**: RT60 0.4-0.6 seconds within the semi-private area
- **Background Noise**: 40-45 dB ambient level to provide adequate masking
- **Noise Intrusion**: Maximum 50 dB from adjacent team conversations

#### Acoustic Material Specifications
**Barrier Materials:**
- **Fabric-wrapped panels**: NRC 0.75-0.95, 50-75mm thick
- **Perforated wood screens**: 20-30% perforation with acoustic backing (NRC 0.60-0.80)
- **Flexible acoustic curtains**: NRC 0.45-0.65 for adjustable privacy

**Ceiling Treatment:**
- **Acoustic clouds**: Suspended panels above seating area (2-3 m² coverage)
- **Sound-absorbing tiles**: NRC 0.70-0.85 in adjacent areas
- **Partial ceiling**: 60-80% coverage to maintain openness while controlling reverberation

**Floor Treatment:**
- **Carpet tiles**: NRC 0.25-0.35 to absorb footfall noise
- **Area rugs**: Define space boundaries while providing acoustic benefit
- **Sound-absorbing underlayment**: In hard-surface areas adjacent to collaboration zones

**Spatial Relationship:**
- Located within 3-5 steps of the team's primary work area
- Part of the team's "territory" rather than shared organizational space
- Visual and physical connection to team artifacts, whiteboards, and displays
- Positioned to not block natural light or circulation paths

### Specific Furniture Configuration Options

#### Standard Configuration (4-6 people)

- Side table or credenza for materials and personal items

**Layout B: Collaborative Work Surface**
- Large collaborative table (1.8m × 1.2m) with mixed seating:
  - 2-3 ergonomic task chairs for extended sessions
  - 2-3 stools for quick discussions
  - Standing-height section (1050mm) for brief interactions
- Dual mobile whiteboards creating L-shaped writing surface
- Integrated power/data access every 600mm along table edge

**Layout C: Lounge-Style Conversation**
- U-shaped soft seating arrangement with central coffee table
- Mix of armchairs and 2-seat sofas facing inward
- Height-adjustable side tables (450-750mm) for laptop use
- Wall-mounted whiteboard with comfortable writing height (900mm center)

#### Modular Furniture Specifications
**Tables:**
- **Flip-top tables**: Quick reconfiguration and storage
- **Nesting tables**: Variable surface area for different group sizes
- **Height-adjustable mechanisms**: Pneumatic or electric (680-1100mm range)
- **Edge design**: Rounded corners, cable management channels
- **Materials**: Durable laminate tops, powder-coated steel bases

**Seating:**
- **Task chairs**: 4-way adjustment, armrests, mesh backs for extended use
- **Mobile stools**: 360° swivel, height-adjustable (450-650mm)
- **Soft seating**: Modular components with commercial-grade upholstery
- **Standing supports**: Lean-rails or perching stools (750-850mm)

**Storage & Display:**
- **Mobile pedestals**: Lockable storage that doubles as side tables
- **Whiteboard towers**: Double-sided, mobile with storage base
- **Pin-up panels**: Fabric-covered, mobile, with integrated storage
- **Technology carts**: Mobile displays with integrated storage and power

### Team Transition Protocols

#### Visual Signals for Space Availability
- **Open Configuration**: Furniture arranged in welcoming circle/U-shape
- **In-Use Configuration**: Chairs pulled close to table, whiteboard in active position
- **Private Discussion**: Acoustic panels positioned for maximum privacy
- **Do Not Disturb**: Specific furniture arrangement or simple signage system

#### Transition Guidelines for Teams
**Joining an Ongoing Discussion:**
- Wait for natural pause or eye contact acknowledgment
- Join peripherally before full participation
- Use visual cues (pointing, nodding) before speaking

**Shifting from Individual to Collaborative Work:**
- Team member initiates by moving toward adjacent space
- Others can join gradually rather than formal meeting start
- Maintain connection to individual work contexts

**Returning to Individual Work:**
- Natural conclusion signals: summarizing, action items, closing laptops
- Gradual departure rather than abrupt ending
- Preserve work artifacts for potential follow-up

#### Noise Management Protocols
**Volume Guidelines:**
- **Conversational Level**: Normal speaking voice (55-60 dB)
- **Active Discussion**: Slightly elevated but not conference-room volume
- **Excited Collaboration**: Brief periods acceptable, return to conversational level

**Consideration Practices:**
- Face inward toward collaboration area, away from individual workers
- Use whiteboards and gestures to reduce vocal volume needs
- Brief check-ins rather than extended debates in semi-private areas

**Equipment and Tools:**
- Small whiteboard or writable wall surface
- Pin-up space for sketches, user stories, or design artifacts
- Power and connectivity for devices
- Optional: small display for screen sharing or reference materials

## Forces
- **Privacy vs. Accessibility**: Need for private conversation balanced with team integration
- **Context vs. Distraction**: Maintaining work context while minimizing noise impact
- **Spontaneity vs. Structure**: Supporting informal collaboration without scheduling overhead
- **Individual vs. Team Space**: Personal territory balanced with team collaboration needs
- **Formality vs. Informality**: Professional enough for clients but casual enough for daily use

## Examples

**Technology Companies:**
- **Spotify**: Squad areas with adjacent "huddle corners" for quick team discussions
- **Google**: Semi-private collaboration nooks adjacent to team seating areas
- **Microsoft**: Team-owned collaboration spaces within engineering floors

**Design Implementations:**
- **High-backed booth seating** creating acoustic privacy while maintaining visual openness
- **Movable acoustic panels** that teams can adjust for different privacy levels
- **Elevated platform areas** that create defined space without walls
- **Corner alcoves** using building architecture to create natural boundaries

## Consequences
