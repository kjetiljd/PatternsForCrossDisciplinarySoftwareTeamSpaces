# Mob Programming Corner

## Summary
Create dedicated spaces where entire teams (4-6 developers) can work together on one task, featuring large displays, flexible seating, and open-yet-defined boundaries.

## Context
Mob programming (or ensemble programming) brings the entire team together to work on a single piece of code simultaneously. This practice requires specialized physical environments that traditional individual workstations or even pair programming setups cannot support.

## Problem
Standard office layouts lack spaces where 4-6 people can comfortably gather around one shared screen for extended periods. Conference rooms are too formal and isolated, while open desk areas lack the focus and equipment needed for intensive collaborative coding sessions.

## Solution
Design dedicated mob programming stations with:

**Display and Table Setup:**
- Large shared display (46" minimum) positioned for visibility from multiple rows
- Spacious table seating 3 people side-by-side comfortably
- Additional standing/sitting space behind the primary row
- Height positioning flexibility in screen mount ensures back-row visibility (top of screen at standing eye level)

**Input and Equipment:**
- Multiple input devices (keyboards, mice) for easy driver rotation
- Single powerful computer connected to the large display
- Wireless peripherals to enable smooth handoffs between team members
- Power outlets and device charging areas

**Spatial Design:**
- Open area with at least two open sides rather than enclosed room
- Movable acoustic panels or whiteboards on wheels for flexible boundaries
- Sound-dampening materials to contain noise without isolation
- Proximity to team workspace but distinct enough for focus

**Furniture and Ergonomics:**
- Adjustable standing desk or platform for sit/stand flexibility
- Mix of seating options: task chairs, bar stools, lounge chairs
- Mobile furniture allowing quick reconfiguration
- Nearby whiteboard space for sketching and note-taking

## Forces
- **Visibility vs. Intimacy:** Large displays must be visible to all while maintaining team connection
- **Focus vs. Accessibility:** Space needs definition without creating barriers to participation
- **Comfort vs. Energy:** Long sessions require comfort while maintaining engagement
- **Inclusion vs. Distraction:** Open design invites stakeholder involvement but can create noise

## Examples
- **Hunter Industries:** Open mob programming areas with large screens and flexible seating arrangements
- **Menlo Innovations:** Dedicated pairing and mobbing stations in open floor plans
- **Pivotal Labs:** Team rooms with large displays and movable furniture for collaborative coding
