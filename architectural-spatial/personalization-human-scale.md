# Personalization and Human Scale

## Summary
Enable teams to shape their space with artifacts, varied textures, and comfortable seating to create environments that feel personal and human-scaled.

## Context
Software teams work in their spaces for extended periods and need environments that feel welcoming, personal, and reflective of their team identity and culture.

## Problem
Sterile, corporate environments can feel impersonal and uninspiring, reducing team satisfaction and failing to support the creative aspects of software development. When spaces appear untouchable and pristine, teams may hesitate to make beneficial adaptations.

## Solution
Allow teams to personalize their spaces with team artifacts, plants, varied textures, and comfortable furniture that reflects their identity and creates a sense of ownership.

**Create permission for modification:**
- Design spaces that invite customization rather than demanding preservation
- Use materials and layouts that gracefully accommodate team modifications
- Make successful personalizations by other teams visible as social proof
- Establish explicit policies that encourage beneficial space adaptation

**Support visible personalization:**
- Provide flexible display areas where teams can show their identity and work
- Allow teams to rearrange furniture and add personal touches
- Preserve successful modifications as examples for other teams
- Document before/after stories of beneficial space evolution

## Forces
- Personal expression vs. professional appearance
- Individual preferences vs. team cohesion
- Maintenance and cleaning requirements vs. personalization
- Cost control vs. allowing customization
- **Social proof effects**: Visible evidence of others' modifications signals that personalization is acceptable and beneficial
