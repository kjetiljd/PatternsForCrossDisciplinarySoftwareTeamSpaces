# Personalization and Human Scale

## Summary
Enable teams to shape their space with artifacts, varied textures, and comfortable seating to create environments that feel personal and human-scaled.

## Context
Software teams work in their spaces for extended periods and need environments that feel welcoming, personal, and reflective of their team identity and culture.

## Problem
Sterile, corporate environments can feel impersonal and uninspiring, reducing team satisfaction and failing to support the creative aspects of software development.

## Solution
Allow teams to personalize their spaces with team artifacts, plants, varied textures, and comfortable furniture that reflects their identity and creates a sense of ownership.

## Forces
- Personal expression vs. professional appearance
- Individual preferences vs. team cohesion
- Maintenance and cleaning requirements vs. personalization
- Cost control vs. allowing customization
