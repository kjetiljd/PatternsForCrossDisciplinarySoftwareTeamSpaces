# Office Connections & Team War Rooms

## Summary
Co-locate frequently collaborating teams and provide dedicated spaces for each cross-functional team to work together intensively.

## Context
Cross-functional software teams need both connections to related teams and dedicated spaces where they can collaborate intensively without interrupting others.

## Problem
Teams that collaborate frequently but are physically separated waste time coordinating and lose opportunities for spontaneous collaboration, while teams without dedicated spaces struggle to maintain focus and team cohesion.

## Solution
Create connected office spaces where related teams are adjacent to each other, while providing each team with a dedicated "war room" or team space for intensive collaboration periods.

## Forces
- Need for team focus vs. inter-team collaboration
- Space efficiency vs. team autonomy
- Noise management vs. communication flow
- Fixed layouts vs. changing team compositions
