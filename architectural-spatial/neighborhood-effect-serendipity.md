# Neighborhood Effect and Serendipity

## Summary
Design common areas and circulation paths to encourage informal cross-team encounters and spontaneous knowledge sharing.

## Context
Innovation and knowledge transfer often happen through informal interactions and chance encounters between people working on different projects or in different domains.

## Problem
Isolated team spaces and direct routing between workspaces and exits minimize opportunities for serendipitous encounters that could lead to valuable cross-pollination of ideas.

## Solution
Create common areas, shared facilities, and circulation paths that naturally bring different teams together, encouraging informal interactions and spontaneous collaboration.

## Forces
- Efficiency of direct routing vs. benefits of chance encounters
- Privacy and focus needs vs. openness to interaction
- Space utilization vs. creating "inefficient" social spaces
- Introverted vs. extroverted interaction preferences
