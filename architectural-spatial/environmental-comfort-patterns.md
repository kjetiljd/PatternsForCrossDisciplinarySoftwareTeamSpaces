# Environmental Comfort Patterns

## Summary
Implement ergonomic furniture, proper lighting, acoustic zoning, and climate control to create physically comfortable work environments that support long-term health and productivity.

## Context
Software developers spend long hours at their workstations and need environments that support their physical health and cognitive performance over extended periods.

## Problem
Poor environmental conditions - inadequate lighting, uncomfortable furniture, excessive noise, or poor air quality - can lead to fatigue, health issues, and reduced productivity.

## Solution
Design work environments with adjustable ergonomic furniture, multiple lighting options, acoustic treatments, and individual climate control to meet diverse comfort needs.

**Collaborative Ergonomics:**
- **Height-adjustable desks**: Sit-stand capabilities essential for pair programming and mob sessions
- **Flexible seating options**: Task chairs, bar stools, and lounge seating to support different collaboration modes
- **Multi-user workstations**: Dual monitor arms and peripheral positioning for comfortable two-person use
- **Posture variety**: Standing platforms, convertible desk surfaces, and mobile seating for extended collaboration

**Enhanced Display and Lighting:**
- **Large monitor positioning**: Mob programming displays at standing eye level to reduce neck strain
- **Glare management**: Anti-glare screens and lighting positioning to support screen sharing
- **Ambient lighting control**: Adjustable lighting that works for both individual focus and group activities
- **Task lighting options**: Personal lighting that doesn't interfere with collaborative work

**Acoustic Design for Collaboration:**
- **Sound containment**: Mobile acoustic panels and dividers to manage collaborative noise
- **Conversation-friendly acoustics**: Sound absorption that contains team discussions without isolation
- **Phone booth adjacency**: Quick access to quiet spaces when team members need private calls
- **Noise management**: Materials and layout that support intensive discussion without disturbing neighbors

## Forces
- Individual comfort preferences vs. standardized solutions
- Cost of high-quality furniture vs. long-term health benefits
- Aesthetic considerations vs. functional requirements
- Energy efficiency vs. individual climate control

## Examples
- **Modern Agile Offices**: Adjustable-height team tables with varied seating options for different collaboration styles
- **Co-working Spaces**: Mobile acoustic panels that teams can position around intensive collaboration areas
- **Tech Companies**: Ergonomic setups specifically designed for pair programming and mob sessions
