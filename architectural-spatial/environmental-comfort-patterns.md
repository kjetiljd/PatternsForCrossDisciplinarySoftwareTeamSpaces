# Environmental Comfort Patterns

## Summary
Use ergonomic furniture, proper lighting, sound control, and climate systems. These create comfortable work spaces that support health and productivity over time.

## Context
Software developers spend long hours at their desks and need work spaces that support their physical health and mental performance.

## Problem
Poor work conditions cause problems. Bad lighting, uncomfortable furniture, too much noise, or poor air quality lead to fatigue, health issues, and lower productivity.

## Solution
Design work spaces with adjustable furniture, multiple lighting options, sound treatments, and climate control to meet different comfort needs.

**Collaborative Ergonomics:**
- **Height-adjustable desks**: Sit-stand capabilities essential for pair programming and mob sessions
- **Flexible seating options**: Task chairs, bar stools, and lounge seating to support different collaboration modes
- **Multi-user workstations**: Dual monitor arms and peripheral positioning for comfortable two-person use
- **Posture variety**: Standing platforms, convertible desk surfaces, and mobile seating for extended collaboration

**Enhanced Display and Lighting:**
- **Large monitor positioning**: Mob programming displays at standing eye level to reduce neck strain
- **Glare management**: Anti-glare screens and lighting positioning to support screen sharing
- **Ambient lighting control**: Adjustable lighting that works for both individual focus and group activities
- **Task lighting options**: Personal lighting that doesn't interfere with collaborative work

**Acoustic Design for Collaboration:**
- **Sound containment**: Mobile acoustic panels and dividers to manage collaborative noise
- **Conversation-friendly acoustics**: Sound absorption that contains team discussions without isolation
- **Phone booth adjacency**: Quick access to quiet spaces when team members need private calls
- **Noise management**: Materials and layout that support team discussions without disturbing neighbors

## Forces
- Individual comfort preferences vs. standard solutions
- Cost of high-quality furniture vs. long-term health benefits
- Looks vs. function
- Energy efficiency vs. individual climate control
- Norwegian building rules vs. international ergonomic standards
- Team collaboration needs vs. individual comfort
