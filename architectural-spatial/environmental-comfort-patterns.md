# Environmental Comfort Patterns

## Summary
Implement ergonomic furniture, proper lighting, acoustic zoning, and climate control to create physically comfortable work environments that support long-term health and productivity.

## Context
Software developers spend long hours at their workstations and need environments that support their physical health and cognitive performance over extended periods.

## Problem
Poor environmental conditions - inadequate lighting, uncomfortable furniture, excessive noise, or poor air quality - can lead to fatigue, health issues, and reduced productivity.

## Solution
Design work environments with adjustable ergonomic furniture, multiple lighting options, acoustic treatments, and individual climate control to meet diverse comfort needs.

## Forces
- Individual comfort preferences vs. standardized solutions
- Cost of high-quality furniture vs. long-term health benefits
- Aesthetic considerations vs. functional requirements
- Energy efficiency vs. individual climate control
