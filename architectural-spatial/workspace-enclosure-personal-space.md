# Workspace Enclosure & Personal Space

## Summary
Provide each person ~60 square feet of dedicated space with partial walls behind or beside them. Include window views and 50-75% enclosure for psychological comfort.

## Context
Individual workstations that balance privacy needs with team connection. They also meet collaboration requirements.

## Problem
Open offices create stress and distraction, while fully closed offices isolate people. Workers need psychological comfort and the ability to focus.

## Solution
Design individual workspaces with specific guidelines:
- **Space**: Minimum 60 square feet (5.5 m²) per person
- **Backing**: Wall behind or to one side of each desk (people feel unsafe with back exposed)
- **View**: Open view at least 8 feet in front for eye rest
- **Enclosure**: 50-75% enclosed with walls or windows (half-height partitions count)
- **Light**: Window view to outside for natural light (Norwegian requirement)
- **Privacy**: No more than 8 people within earshot or sight

**Privacy metrics for visual and acoustic performance:**
- **Visual privacy levels**: 
  - Level 1 (Minimal): 30-40% enclosure, peripheral vision screening only
  - Level 2 (Moderate): 50-65% enclosure, blocks direct sight lines while seated
  - Level 3 (High): 70-85% enclosure, prevents visual distraction when standing
- **Acoustic privacy measurements**:
  - Speech Privacy Index (SPI) of 80-95 for confidential conversations
  - Background noise levels of 45-48 dB for concentration
  - Sound masking coefficient of 0.65-0.80 to reduce speech intelligibility
  - Maximum 10 dB difference between workspace and corridor sound levels

**Territorial markers for personal space boundaries:**
- **Physical demarcation**: Floor patterns, carpet edges, or slight level changes to define personal territory
- **Transition zones**: 18-24 inch "approach buffers" using planters, low storage, or desk orientation
- **Personal storage visibility**: Shelving or storage that displays individual ownership without creating barriers
- **Lighting control**: Individual task lighting that creates a personal "pool" of focused illumination
- **Digital boundaries**: Positioning of monitors to naturally screen workspace from casual viewing

**Cultural variations in personal space requirements:**
- **Nordic/Germanic cultures**: Require larger personal territories (70-80 sq ft), prefer higher visual privacy, comfortable with minimal social interaction
- **Latin/Mediterranean cultures**: Comfortable with closer proximity (50-60 sq ft), prefer lower partitions for easier communication, value visual connection to colleagues
- **East Asian cultures**: Variable depending on context—formal work requires clear hierarchy in seating, but collaborative work benefits from flexible boundaries
- **Anglo cultures**: Moderate territorial needs (60-70 sq ft), balance individual privacy with team accessibility, prefer subtle rather than explicit boundary markers
- **Generational considerations**: Younger workers often prefer lower partitions and more visual connection, while experienced workers typically value higher acoustic privacy

## Forces
- People need psychological safety and territorial comfort
- Concentration requires freedom from constant interruption
- Teams need visual connection and easy communication
- Building codes require natural light and views
- Different personality types have varying privacy needs

## Examples

**Scandinavian tech companies**: Many Norwegian software companies implement 70-80 sq ft individual workstations with 65-75% enclosure. They incorporate natural wood territorial markers and individual lighting controls. This respects cultural preferences for personal space and autonomy.

**Silicon Valley startups**: Often balance open collaboration with individual focus through modular systems. These feature 65 sq ft workstations with moveable partitions that teams can adjust based on project phases. They typically maintain 50-60% enclosure.

**Japanese software development teams**: Implement hierarchical seating arrangements within team clusters. Senior developers receive higher visual privacy (70%+ enclosure) while junior team members work in more open configurations (40-50% enclosure). This facilitates mentoring.

**European consulting firms**: Use subtle territorial markers like distinctive desk materials, personal storage towers, and individual task lighting. These create psychological ownership within flexible seating arrangements that can accommodate client meetings.

**Remote-first companies' satellite offices**: Design highly flexible individual spaces (60-75 sq ft) with multiple privacy levels. This allows workers accustomed to home office control to choose their preferred level of enclosure and territorial definition.
