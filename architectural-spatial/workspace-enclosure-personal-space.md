# Workspace Enclosure & Personal Space

## Summary
Provide each person ~60 square feet of dedicated space with partial walls behind or beside them, window views, and 50-75% enclosure for psychological comfort.

## Context
Individual workstations that balance privacy needs with team connection and collaboration requirements.

## Problem
Open offices create stress and distraction, while fully closed offices isolate people. Workers need psychological comfort and the ability to focus.

## Solution
Design individual workspaces with specific guidelines:
- **Space**: Minimum 60 square feet (5.5 mÂ²) per person
- **Backing**: Wall behind or to one side of each desk (people feel unsafe with back exposed)
- **View**: Open view at least 8 feet in front for eye rest
- **Enclosure**: 50-75% enclosed with walls or windows (half-height partitions count)
- **Light**: Window view to outside for natural light (Norwegian requirement)
- **Privacy**: No more than 8 people within earshot or sight

## Forces
- People need psychological safety and territorial comfort
- Concentration requires freedom from constant interruption
- Teams need visual connection and easy communication
- Building codes require natural light and views
- Different personality types have varying privacy needs

## Examples
- Alexander's empirical workspace studies showing optimal dimensions
- Norwegian workplace regulations mandating daylight access
- Basecamp's "library rules" creating quiet, respectful workspaces
