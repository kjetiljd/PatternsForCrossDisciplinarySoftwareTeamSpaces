# Call Booths

## Summary
Create small, soundproof privacy pods near team work areas. These pods give team members a quiet space for phone calls, video conferences, and focused work. The pods provide acoustic isolation while keeping team members close to their team.

## Context
Open team environments help teams collaborate and share information naturally. However, they lack private spaces for phone calls, sensitive conversations, or tasks that need full focus. Traditional solutions like booking meeting rooms create barriers and scheduling overhead.

## Problem
Team members need occasional privacy for:
- Individual phone calls and video conferences
- Sensitive conversations that require confidentiality
- Deep focus work requiring acoustic isolation
- Quick private discussions without formal meeting overhead

Current solutions create problems:
- **Booking Meeting Rooms**: Creates scheduling overhead and separates individuals from team context
- **Open Area Calls**: Disturbs team members and lacks privacy for caller
- **Leaving the Office**: Breaks work flow and removes person from team availability

## Solution
Install small, soundproof privacy pods within or right next to team work areas. Provide single-person capacity with sound-dampening materials that significantly reduce noise transmission. Include ventilation, lighting, and technology integration for video calls. Position within steps of team work area while maintaining visual connection.

## Forces
- **Privacy vs. Accessibility**: Acoustic isolation balanced with team integration
- **Individual Needs vs. Team Awareness**: Personal space without complete disconnection
- **Cost vs. Benefit**: Investment in pods versus productivity gains from reduced distraction
- **Space Efficiency vs. Availability**: Limited pods must serve multiple team members
- **Aesthetics vs. Function**: Professional appearance balanced with acoustic performance

## Evidence
Research supports the need for acoustic privacy solutions:
- **Productivity Impact**: Workers are usually 15% less productive in open office environments due to distractions
- **Focus Recovery**: It takes 20 minutes to regain focus after being interrupted by noise
- **Phone Call Frequency**: Average knowledge worker takes 8-12 phone calls per day that need some privacy
- **Meeting Room Waste**: 30-40% of booked meeting rooms are used for individual calls that could use smaller spaces

## Examples

**Technology Companies:**
- **Zendesk**: Phone booths throughout open office floors for individual calls
- **Dropbox**: Privacy pods integrated into team work areas
- **Automattic**: Soundproof booths for video calls in distributed team collaboration

**Design Solutions:**
- **ROOM Phone Booths**: Pre-fabricated soundproof pods with integrated technology
- **Zenbooth**: Modular privacy solutions with ventilation and lighting
- **Custom Built**: Acoustic booths designed specifically for office integration
- **Steelcase Pods**: Furniture-based privacy solutions with sound dampening

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced Open Area Noise**: Phone calls and video conferences don't disturb team work
- **Maintained Privacy**: Confidential conversations can happen without booking formal rooms
- **Preserved Team Connection**: Visual connection maintains awareness and availability
- **Improved Focus**: Acoustic isolation enables concentrated work when needed
- **Flexibility**: No scheduling required for individual privacy needs

### Negative
- **Limited Availability**: Pods may be occupied when needed
- **Space Investment**: Requires dedicated square footage and equipment investment
- **Maintenance Needs**: Ventilation, cleaning, and technology upkeep required
- **Psychological Barriers**: Some people may feel claustrophobic in small enclosed spaces
