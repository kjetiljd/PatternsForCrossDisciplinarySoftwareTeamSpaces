# Call Booths

## Summary
Provide small, soundproof privacy pods within or adjacent to team work areas for individual phone calls, video conferences, and focused work that requires acoustic isolation without complete separation from the team.

## Context
Open team environments enable collaboration and osmotic communication but lack private spaces for individual phone calls, sensitive conversations, or tasks requiring complete focus. Traditional solutions like booking meeting rooms create barriers and scheduling overhead.

## Problem
Team members need occasional privacy for:
- Individual phone calls and video conferences
- Sensitive conversations that require confidentiality
- Deep focus work requiring acoustic isolation
- Quick private discussions without formal meeting overhead

Current solutions create problems:
- **Booking Meeting Rooms**: Creates scheduling overhead and separates individuals from team context
- **Open Area Calls**: Disturbs team members and lacks privacy for caller
- **Leaving the Office**: Breaks work flow and removes person from team availability

## Solution
Install small, soundproof privacy pods within or immediately adjacent to team work areas:

**Physical Design:**
- Single-person capacity (approximately 4x4 feet internal space)
- Sound-dampening materials reducing noise transmission by 25-30 decibels
- Clear sides or windows to maintain visual connection while providing acoustic privacy
- Ventilation system for air circulation during extended use
- Interior lighting optimized for video calls

**Technology Integration:**
- Power outlets for device charging
- USB and power connectivity
- Small shelf or surface for laptop and notes
- Optional: integrated webcam and microphone for video calls
- Wi-Fi signal boost if needed for connectivity

**Spatial Integration:**
- Located within 10-15 steps of team work area
- Multiple pods per team cluster to avoid queuing
- Positioned to not block natural light or emergency egress
- Clear sight lines from team area for availability awareness

**Ergonomic Features:**
- Comfortable seating for calls up to 30-45 minutes
- Adjustable height desk surface
- Adequate interior space to avoid claustrophobia
- Easy entry/exit without awkward maneuvering

## Forces
- **Privacy vs. Accessibility**: Acoustic isolation balanced with team integration
- **Individual Needs vs. Team Awareness**: Personal space without complete disconnection
- **Cost vs. Benefit**: Investment in pods versus productivity gains from reduced distraction
- **Space Efficiency vs. Availability**: Limited pods must serve multiple team members
- **Aesthetics vs. Function**: Professional appearance balanced with acoustic performance

## Evidence
Research supports the need for acoustic privacy solutions:
- **Productivity Impact**: Workers are typically 15% less productive in open office environments due to distractions
- **Focus Recovery**: It takes 20 minutes to regain focus after being interrupted by noise
- **Phone Call Frequency**: Average knowledge worker takes 8-12 phone calls per day requiring some privacy
- **Meeting Room Waste**: 30-40% of booked meeting rooms are used for individual calls that could use smaller spaces

## Examples

**Technology Companies:**
- **Zendesk**: Phone booths throughout open office floors for individual calls
- **Dropbox**: Privacy pods integrated into team work areas
- **Automattic**: Soundproof booths for video calls in distributed team collaboration

**Design Solutions:**
- **ROOM Phone Booths**: Pre-fabricated soundproof pods with integrated technology
- **Zenbooth**: Modular privacy solutions with ventilation and lighting
- **Custom Built**: Acoustic booths designed specifically for office integration
- **Steelcase Pods**: Furniture-based privacy solutions with sound dampening

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced Open Area Noise**: Phone calls and video conferences don't disturb team work
- **Maintained Privacy**: Confidential conversations can happen without booking formal rooms
- **Preserved Team Connection**: Visual connection maintains awareness and availability
- **Improved Focus**: Acoustic isolation enables concentrated work when needed
- **Flexibility**: No scheduling required for individual privacy needs

### Negative
- **Limited Availability**: Pods may be occupied when needed
- **Space Investment**: Requires dedicated square footage and equipment investment
- **Maintenance Needs**: Ventilation, cleaning, and technology upkeep required
- **Psychological Barriers**: Some people may feel claustrophobic in small enclosed spaces
- **Usage Conflicts**: Teams may need protocols for fair access during busy periods

## Implementation

**Planning Phase:**
1. **Assess Team Needs**: Survey current phone call and privacy requirements
2. **Space Analysis**: Identify optimal locations that don't block light or circulation
3. **Acoustic Testing**: Measure current noise levels and booth effectiveness
4. **Technology Requirements**: Determine power, connectivity, and integration needs

**Installation:**
1. **Professional Installation**: Ensure proper ventilation and electrical connections
2. **Acoustic Verification**: Test sound reduction and booth-to-outside noise transmission
3. **Technology Integration**: Install and test power, connectivity, and optional A/V equipment
4. **Safety Compliance**: Verify emergency egress and accessibility requirements

**Team Integration:**
1. **Usage Protocols**: Establish etiquette for booth access and time limits
2. **Booking Systems**: Implement simple reservation system if needed
3. **Maintenance Procedures**: Create cleaning and upkeep schedules
4. **Feedback Collection**: Monitor usage patterns and satisfaction

## Usage Guidelines
- **Time Limits**: 30-45 minute maximum sessions to ensure availability
- **Visual Availability**: Keep booth visible to team for awareness
- **Emergency Protocol**: Clear exit procedures and emergency communication
- **Hygiene Standards**: Regular cleaning and ventilation maintenance
- **Conflict Resolution**: Fair usage policies during high-demand periods
