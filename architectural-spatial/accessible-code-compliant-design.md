# Accessible & Code-Compliant Design

## Summary
Ensure daylight access, universal accessibility, and healthy indoor climate by design to create inclusive and legally compliant work environments.

## Context
Software team spaces must comply with building codes and accessibility requirements while promoting health, well-being, and inclusivity for all team members.

## Problem
Workspaces that don't meet accessibility standards exclude potential team members, while poor indoor climate and lack of daylight can negatively impact productivity and well-being.

## Solution
Design all team spaces to exceed accessibility requirements, ensure abundant natural light, maintain optimal air quality and temperature, and create inclusive environments that accommodate diverse needs.

## Forces
- Legal compliance requirements vs. cost considerations
- Universal design principles vs. specific team needs
- Natural light access vs. privacy and glare concerns
- Energy efficiency vs. comfort requirements
