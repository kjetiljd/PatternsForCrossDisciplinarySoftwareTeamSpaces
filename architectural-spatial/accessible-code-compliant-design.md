# Accessible & Code-Compliant Design

## Summary
Ensure daylight access, universal accessibility, and healthy indoor climate by design to create inclusive and legally compliant work environments that support neurodiversity and varying abilities.

## Context
Software team spaces must comply with building codes and accessibility requirements while promoting health, well-being, and inclusivity for all team members. Modern teams include individuals with diverse physical, cognitive, and sensory needs that must be accommodated through thoughtful design rather than retrofitted accommodations.

## Problem
Workspaces that don't meet accessibility standards exclude potential team members, while poor indoor climate and lack of daylight negatively impact productivity and well-being. Many organizations address accessibility as an afterthought, creating segregated or compromised solutions rather than truly inclusive environments. Sensory accessibility needs are often overlooked, creating barriers for neurodiverse team members.

## Solution
Design all team spaces to exceed accessibility requirements using universal design principles, ensure abundant natural light with controllable systems, maintain optimal air quality and temperature with individual control options, and create inclusive environments that proactively accommodate diverse physical, cognitive, and sensory needs.

### Norwegian Building Code Compliance (TEK17)

#### Physical Accessibility Requirements
- **Clear Width**: Minimum 1200mm (47") for primary circulation
- **Door Width**: Minimum 850mm (33.5") clear opening width
- **Height Adjustability**: Work surfaces 700-1200mm (27.5"-47.2") range
- **Reach Ranges**: Controls 400-1200mm (15.7"-47.2") above floor
- **Ramp Specifications**: Maximum 1:20 (5%) gradient for access routes
- **Elevator Access**: Required for multi-story facilities

#### Daylight and Indoor Climate Standards
- **Daylight Factor**: Minimum 2% in all occupied spaces
- **Natural Light Access**: Every workspace within 6m of window
- **Fresh Air Supply**: Minimum 26 m³/h per person
- **Temperature Control**: 20-24°C (68-75°F) with ±2°C adjustment capability
- **Relative Humidity**: 30-60% year-round
- **Noise Levels**: Maximum 40 dB for concentrated work areas

## Forces
- Legal compliance requirements vs. cost considerations
- Universal design principles vs. specific team needs  
- Natural light access vs. privacy and glare concerns
- Energy efficiency vs. comfort requirements
- Standardization vs. individual accommodation needs
- Proactive inclusion vs. reactive accommodation

- **Sensory Regulation**: Quiet retreat spaces, adjustable environmental controls
- **Predictable Layout**: Consistent navigation patterns, clear spatial organization
- **Stimulation Control**: Ability to adjust lighting, noise, visual complexity
- **Choice and Flexibility**: Multiple workspace types for different cognitive needs

### Retrofit Guidance for Existing Spaces

#### Priority 1: Critical Accessibility (Immediate)
- **Path of Travel**: Ensure accessible route from entrance to all work areas
- **Emergency Egress**: Accessible evacuation routes and procedures
- **Restroom Accessibility**: At least one fully accessible restroom per floor
- **Basic Technology**: Screen readers, adjustable displays, alternative input devices

#### Priority 2: Enhanced Inclusion (6-12 months)
- **Workstation Adjustability**: Height-adjustable desks and seating
- **Environmental Controls**: Individual temperature and lighting controls
- **Acoustic Treatments**: Sound absorption in high-noise areas
- **Wayfinding Improvements**: Clear signage and navigation aids

#### Priority 3: Universal Design Excellence (12-24 months)
- **Sensory Rooms**: Dedicated quiet spaces for sensory regulation
- **Advanced Technology**: Voice recognition, eye-tracking, haptic feedback
- **Microenvironment Control**: Personal air quality and light controls
- **Flexible Infrastructure**: Modular systems for future adaptability

### Compliance Verification and Monitoring

#### Regular Assessment Schedule
- **Monthly**: Environmental measurements (light, temperature, noise, air quality)
- **Quarterly**: Technology accessibility audits and user feedback collection
- **Annually**: Professional accessibility assessment and code compliance review
- **As-Needed**: Individual accommodation assessments and space modifications

#### Documentation Requirements
