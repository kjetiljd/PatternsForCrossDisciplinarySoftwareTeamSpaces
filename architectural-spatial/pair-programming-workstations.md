# Pair Programming Workstations

## Summary
Design dedicated desks for two people to comfortably work at one machine, promoting collaborative coding through ergonomic shared workspaces.

## Context
Modern software development increasingly relies on pair programming for knowledge sharing, code quality, and team learning. However, most office furniture is designed for individual work, making pair programming awkward and physically uncomfortable.

## Problem
Traditional L-shaped desks, corner workstations, and narrow desks force pairing partners into uncomfortable positions - leaning over shoulders, sharing inadequate space, or struggling with limited access to peripherals. This physical discomfort discourages pair programming and reduces its effectiveness.

## Solution
Create dedicated pair programming workstations with:

**Desk Design:**
- Long, straight-edged desks (minimum 160Ã—80 cm) with no corner obstructions
- Rectangular layout that allows a second chair to sit side-by-side easily
- Height-adjustable surfaces or platforms to accommodate different preferences
- Sufficient depth for dual monitors and adequate working space

**Equipment Configuration:**
- Two-user, one-machine setup with dual monitors, keyboards, and mice
- Both peripherals connected to a single computer for seamless control transfer
- Large monitors (24" minimum) positioned for comfortable viewing by both users
- Cable management to prevent workspace clutter

**Seating and Ergonomics:**
- Two adjustable task chairs that can be positioned side-by-side
- Optional bar-height stools for standing collaboration
- Adequate legroom and personal space for extended sessions

## Forces
- **Collaboration vs. Individual Work:** Stations must support intensive pairing while remaining usable for solo development
- **Physical Comfort:** Extended pairing sessions require ergonomic consideration for both participants
- **Equipment Sharing:** Technical setup must enable smooth role transitions between driver and navigator
- **Space Efficiency:** Dedicated pairing stations require more floor space than individual workstations

## Examples
- **Fog Creek Software:** Used extra-long rectangular desks instead of L-shaped ones to invite pairing partners without awkward positioning
- **Thoughtworks:** Implemented wide bench-style desks that could accommodate two developers comfortably
- **Modern Agile Offices:** Mobile workstations on wheels that can be combined for pairing or separated for focus work
