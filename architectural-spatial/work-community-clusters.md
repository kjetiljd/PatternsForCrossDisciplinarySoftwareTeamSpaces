# Work Community Clusters

## Summary
Design workplaces as small communities of 10â€“20 workspaces grouped around a shared common area (courtyard or square) with amenities like coffee, lunch counters, and greenspace.

## Context
Creating human-scale workplace neighborhoods that foster informal interaction and team identity while maintaining connection to the larger organization.

## Problem
Large open offices or isolated team spaces fail to create the right balance of community and focus. Teams need both identity and connection to other teams.

## Solution
Organize workspaces into clusters that feel like small villages or neighborhoods. Each cluster should:
- Accommodate 10-20 people maximum
- Have a central common area (like a courtyard or square)
- Include shared amenities (coffee station, lunch counter, informal seating)
- Feel semi-autonomous while connected to the larger organization
- Ensure every workstation has access to natural light (Norwegian compliance)

## Forces
- People need both belonging to a small group and connection to the larger community
- Informal interaction drives innovation and knowledge sharing
- Teams need identity and focus without isolation
- Norwegian regulations require daylight access for all workstations
- Accessibility requirements must be met throughout

## Examples
- Alexander's "Work Community" (Pattern 41) treating workplace like a neighborhood
- Corporate campuses with team clusters around atriums
- Basecamp's quiet "library rules" with social kitchen areas
