# Scattered Work and Campus Layout

## Summary
Distribute teams across mixed-use areas rather than isolated office parks to create more vibrant, integrated work environments.

## Context
Software teams often find themselves in isolated office parks or corporate campuses that lack the vibrancy and diverse interactions found in mixed-use urban environments.

## Problem
Isolated office environments can lead to insular thinking, limited cross-pollination of ideas, and a disconnect from the broader community and market context.

## Solution
Integrate software team spaces into mixed-use developments where possible, or create campus layouts that incorporate diverse functions and encourage interaction with the broader community.

## Forces
- Need for focused work environment vs. benefits of diverse interactions
- Security and confidentiality requirements vs. openness to community
- Cost considerations of mixed-use vs. dedicated office space
- Accessibility and transportation considerations
